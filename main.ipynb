       "'Looks durable Charging is fine tooNo complains,Charging is really fast, good product.,Till now satisfied with the quality.,This is a good product . The charging speed is slower than the original iPhone cable,Good quality, would recommend,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/81---F1ZgHL._SY88.jpg,Product had worked well till date and was having no issue.Cable is also sturdy enough...Have asked for replacement and company is doing the same...,Value for money I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it\\'s still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn\\'t ever thought that this cable will be so long it\\'s good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter\\'s old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can\\'t blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place. Not quite durable and sturdy,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71rIggrbUCL._SY88.jpg,Working good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61bKp9YO6wL._SY88.jpg,Product,Very nice product,Working well,It\\'s a really nice product Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product Bought this instead of original apple, does the work for 150rs, not as fast as apple charger but its a good option if you want cheap and good product, bought it for iPad pro 10.5 and it\\'s working flawlessly, build quality is ok, its not like i am gonna hang my clothes on it and i want a very strong cable, even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don\\'t buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it\\'s stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It’s good.

Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet.

Nylon Shielded core wire it improves the life of the cable.,i think i buy these every 6 months or so. fast charging stops working after a while. probbly something to do with the cable design. the cable gets twisted over time and I suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside. but i keep buying it because there arent too many options in an L shaped design,Good and durable product.

About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the \\'so called free\\' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it\\'s pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It\\'s awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can\\'t use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it\\'s a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It\\'s running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it\\'s good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn\\'t happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(₹11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money The signal is too unstable once connect you need a bit of adjustment by unplugging or moving the wire to get a proper signal. But does the job. Go for this if you want to experiment with HDMI as I wasn\\'t sure it would work for me or not. Otherwise go for a good quality breaded cable.,Good product,The cable did not come in a box. There is no box. If this was to be shipped without any packaging or branding, same should have been mentioned. When we pay for hi quality products, we expect a certain quality! I still have no idea if this is a hi speed 4k cable or not.,Good,Bought to connect my CP monitor (CCTV) to MI android TV.. .. OK quality at this price,I give it a 5 on 5, reasons as below..1. Amazon delivery - Super fast, same day delivery within 4-5 Hours.2. The delivery person was good.3.  Robust Built Quality, looks & feels premium.4. It is working excellent, I\\'m using for lapptop to big screen TV connectivity, and could see the undistorted picture and sound, nicely doing its work.A few words of cons..1. Feels a little hard to adjust and bend as per requirement, less flexible. But this may not be a serious concern.Overall a nice experience so far.,Good job,Like. This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV. I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It\\'s average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I\\'ll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don\\'t have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it\\'s very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I\\'m ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I\\'m very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it\\'s been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I\\'m having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don\\'t have a aux cable so I\\'m not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won\\'t work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won\\'t connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it\\'s a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it\\'s been 4 months and it\\'s super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that\\'s all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I\\'m happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good. The product seems and works good but it\\'s not a fast  charging cable as it has to be and when all the three ports are connected its more slower I\\'m charging  only good is single cable all three ports are there so its a ok product only if yiu are looking for fast charging then I would say think twice before you buyI have been using foe a while now this is for sure not a fast charging cable and in this tge lightning charger is not working properly every now and then I have to check its it charging my iPhone and I had to unplug and reply for charging its getting disconnected I don\\'t understand how  so this cable is no ok,i used this type c most commonly depending on my devices power wats and also etc,,Nice charger,Charging is bit slow when u connect multiple devices.Cannot transfer data.Only Charging purpose.,So nice colour cheap and best,The cable looks decent with charging.

Connectors are gold plated and will not rust.But remember, this cable will not give USB 3.0 speeds even if you connect it to a USB 3.0 port.,For Usb 2.0 , any usb 3.0 if used will behave as usb 2.0Type: ADirection: female to maleFunction: extension of length of usbBuilt: average  not cloth/fibre braiderLength: as mentionedWorks for all connections: yes [including pc\\\\printer\\\\console pen drive etc ],Product is as per description,Good as expected. The cable build quality is good for normal charging its great cable but doesn’t support quick charging,Works for charging but other applications are hit or miss.Example my external keyboard doesn\\'t work with it!,Best quality and length of wire was qute good and durability also good .,The cable is awesome and no charging issue till now.... Because it is a braided cable... Chance of it damage are very less... Overall... I like the product 🤞🏻,Using this cable from past 40 days to charge lg g7thinq and samsung s21fe.  So far super,Good,Seems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough / base of the pin is too thick that i couldn\\'t insert it into my phone\\'s charging port without removing the case!,Over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin ₹99 me 1.5m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai. Maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai. Agar ₹150 me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai. Not charging as fast as I\\'d have expected. Maybe something wrong with my unit. However, the cable overall is actually pretty decent. The material is great, it doesn\\'t bend out of shape very easily, and looks (and feels) premium. The length is definitely a plus!,Good,A sturdy cable for mobile charging.,It\\'s been 1 month that i am using this charging cable, works very well with S20 FE 5G. Thumbs up.,Braided cable is sturdy and built well. Long cable adds extra reach and is tangle free.,A good buy. The extra length helps a lot.,Good product,Ok Buy it,Received in good condition and is working properly,This price cabil not good,  and also short,I am using from 2 months and charging the phone in good way and it\\'s really value for money.. i recommend this cable.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71CEI3G+BLL._SY88.jpg,The cable is perfect for 3A charging devices . Support super fast charging and can be used in vehicle chargers and adapters. sturdy and durable for daily use,Best cable i have ever used by amazon .worth it . Guys just take it,Good Quality.but over priced It\\'s a good data cable and I recommend it to purchase,the only issue was the metal pin is not fixed firmly so it has become loose,otherwise no issue,must purchase,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SgnWv1ML._SY88.jpg,Charging cable which is sturdy it\\'s not a fast charging cable but the three outlets does the job.,Good sturdy micro usb cable with good charging speeds. Please don\\'t raise prices,Nice product, a simpla microusb cable,😂,Best for this price,Good one It\\'s a good product.,Like,Very good item strong and useful USB cableValue for moneyThanks to amazon and producer,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51112ZRE-1L._SY88.jpg,Good,Nice product and useful product,-,Sturdy but does not support 33w charging Good budget mfi certified lightly cable for this price . Update usage review after 3 to 5 months .,Better than the original one in matter of robustness and durability. Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified, It does the job really well. No complaints regarding the charging power. At a price of Rs. 199/-, it is worth every buck. Although this cable is a bit shorter than the original one, but the original OnePlus cable is around Rs.900/-. So there is a huge price difference, and it does the same job as the original one.,Useful for “c” type charging. But not suitable with all adapters or USB points. Serves the purpose.,Sturdily built. Does its job well. Charged my Samsung Galaxy M51 quicker than the original cable. Hope it stays the same going ahead.,Liked the charging speed disliked the length. On iPads this is awesome but it’s is not 6 foot long so this the only point to think otherwise it is the best cable,Good,Everything is good including connectivity and stuff,Nice product..im using this for my car,This product is nice and worth the amount...I recommend it to anyone who are looking for this kind of cable I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage: Continuous, OTT only, no Cable/Dish operator.Average daily usage: 6-8 hours.The TV is a great value-for-money product.Installation: The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.Picture: The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn\\'t look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else\\'s better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn\\'t need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It\\'s exactly like Amazon\\'s remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn\\'t find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn’t faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It’s like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can’t eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it’s good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn’t arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn’t came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn’t got the replacement for the product and it’s totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4 ⭐ for picture quality, 3⭐ for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen Same type is available in half prize other make on Amazon,Cable is good and well built. it supports all sort of charging protocols. But Samsung galaxy s8 ultra seems to have some issues. It falls back to slower charging after a second or two of ultra fast charging when plugged in. It works fine with other devices just fine.,Quality of yhe cable is good. My cable is not working after 8 months. Duracell team is very responsive. They replaced the item immediately. Service is good. But only one problem is thickness of the pin must be improved.,The product is upto my expectations, worth the price, braiding is really good, i may not have the need to buy another cable again,Worth buying this cable, very durable,Its very tough material and very much durable too.,Super fast charging...long lasting due to sturdiness & strong build quality...absolute value for money product...plus 2yrs warranty...Sometime bit difficult to fold the cable due to its sturdy build but its OK looking at its edge...just go for it....a real value for money.,Very sturdy but over priced Using it and satisfactory.,Working good also not so expensive,Using this for an audio transition from Yamaha mgxu20 sound mixer to the laptop for live purpose excellent quality.,Bought it before one and a half month.... Works well.. Satisfied...🙂,Good quality, and cheap price,Great for the price works with my usb mic fantastically well. Just I find the usb b side is a bit loose when compared to my original OEM cables.. I have ordered several pairs but all are same. At least for my mic. But it’s not too loose to be called unusable,Works with my Casio ct-x700 well, NOTE:@ If you select brand-authorized TV installation, then DO NOT unbox the tv until MI representative arrives.This ensures, that if TV is damaged in transportation, then you will get replacement easily.@ If you didn\\'t choose installation, then just SHOOT the video of unboxing by yourself, to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed.@ Amazon Prime and Netflix are not inbuilt, but can be Side-loaded !!!@ To use your Set top box with android interface, you need to buy MI IR cable and set it up.* OR else directly connect the set up box via AV or HDMI port, to use it conventionally.@ Out of 8GB memory, you only get around 4.7GB free to use (check the image attached)There are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube, but NONE explains the TV\\'s potential completely and what its actual flaws are. Here\\'s a quick Fact for the User\\'s complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees & here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K. So just check once, what options you have before complaining.Eventually I bought this TV, since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks, I am stating my DETAILED user experience. Its a detailed & huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount.●● If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ●●# Firstly its budget friendly & ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market.# Has Most number of Output port ( 1*AV, 3*HDMI, 2*USB ).# Has Android 8.1 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth# Has Dual interface - MI Patchwall & Android TV ( I mostly prefer android TV interface )# Remote has Bluetooth & Voice Search with sleek profile.# Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM + 8GB storage ( 4.7GB actual )# Speaker Output is low.# Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface.# Amazon prime & Netflix is NOT preloaded, but can be side loaded.# Native Display is ONLY HD, though 1080p & even 4K videos from youtube works well (check images attached).# Can install & play tons of High quality games like RR3, etc (check images attached).# Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time.FULL DETAILED REVIEW :---->BUILT QUALITY :------------------# Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. Its not great, but above average.# Table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable.* The screws which are provided in the box, DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly, so I bought new from local store.# It has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market.# Speaker Placement is inconvenient. Since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge.# Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up.# Overall built quality is above average.DISPLAY QUALITY :---------------------# It has very Thin bezels, which looks great.# Video resolution is 1366x768p, but 1080p videos works fine on it.* 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well.# Viewing angle are good compared to price. ( Check the images attached )# Contrast is above average, Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid.# Display quality is also above average, not very great.REMOTE CONTROL :-----------------------# Its very sleek and compact.# Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate.# Fortunately it has Volume buttons, which is handy. ( I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote, so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume :P )# Placement of Voice search button is improper. Its just below Power button, and I end up pressing power button a lot.# Finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation.OTHER FEATURES :---------------------# It has Dual interface, i.e. Patchwall and android TV.  Has tons of content.# Many games can be installed (till you have memory left), including multiplayer games.# Google voice search is very useful, if you don\\'t want to use keyboard.# Processing speed is fast and I haven\\'t detected any lags yet. ( Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware )# Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly.CONS :------# Speaker output though rated 20W, is NOT upto the mark. My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound.# Placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens.# Internal Memory is very LESS.# NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them.# Miracast not supported. Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes.# Native resolution is just 720p HD, though the 1080p videos works on usb & 4K on youtube.# Screen is Slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other LED tv\\'s.# Mixed experiences of after sales service.CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------# Firstly the installation is a Joke. My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is, there\\'s ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product :P# Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative, so there\\'s NO point of return window time frame.# MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services. Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet, I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful.VERDICT :-----------Considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average Display quality, want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the TV you should certainly go for. Trust me, you won\\'t get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. If you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc.This is NOT a perfect smart TV, but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty, its NO brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.,This television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of ₹12500.Performance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐-----------------------The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box. VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media support.Picture Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐--------------------------Many people complain about the overbright screen. But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings.These are my preferred settings.Backlight :1 to 20*********************During night even the lowest value of 1 is  bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes.During day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. A maximum of 20 would be enough.Setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during night.Brightness :48*****************Brightness setting controls black level.Increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast.Brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationAt 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies.48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details.Contrast : 40 to 45*********************Contrast setting controls white level.Contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. As the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast.Saturation: 45 to 50************************Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. At 45 colors look more natural. At 50 colors looks a bit punchy. But still its a personal preference.At the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p . The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TV.LG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black DemoLG OLED Eclipse 2 DemoLG HD Demo Art NouveauFull HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV. Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named \\'Life Untouched\\' and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium. Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good details.Screen Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐--------------------------I think this is a VA panel , the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels. The screen is glossy and hence reflective. This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing it.Like all other LCD panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that\\'s only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. While watching movies or other content it\\'s not at all a problem. Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etc.Luckily there\\'s no backlight bleeding in the unit  I received.Viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that\\'s a common VA panel characteristic. IPS panels with good viewing angles can\\'t be expected at this price point.All LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. VA panels excels in black depth despite it\\'s average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levels.Sound Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐--------------------------Bass is a bit weak (I think bass is improved following some updates. So giving 5 stars from 4.) It\\'s very loud even at low volume. Midrange and treble are very good. Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly.Edit:In a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good. But it isn\\'t.100Hz : 7300Hz : 81000Hz : 43500 Hz : 610000 Hz : 5A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled.The following settings sounds much better and here\\'s the reason.100 Hz : 8 - BassFrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare etc.300 Hz : 4 - Low MidrangeEnhances bass and depth of male vocals. Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 Hz : 3 - MidrangeImparts a metallic tone. Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant.3500 Hz : 5 - Upper MidrangeVocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. A value of 5 enhances vocal quality. Increasing too much makes vocals harsh.10000 Hz : 7 -TrebleAdds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. Enhances tinkling  sounds of metallic  instruments.Human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here it\\'s 1000 and 3500 Hz. Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. Even increasing 300Hz is disturbing.Great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. But considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars.Remote Control ⭐⭐⭐⭐-----------------------------Minimalism is great. But minimalism with less functionality is not so great. Addition ofMute,TV Settings and Video input selection buttons would \\'ve made the remote more functional.App support ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐(Update)-----------------------When the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime. But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime. Now the TV deserves 5 stars for app support.Pros and Cons--------------------------- Pros:1. Powerful processor for 4K media playback.2. App installation via USB3. Built in Chromecast4. Bluetooth remote5. Voice CommandCons: (Update)Previously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby option.But in the latest update both these issues are solved.Now when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input sourceTo enable it, go to Settngs >Inputs > Enable \\'Stay on the previous source\\' option.Screen off feature is also added in the new update. Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off option.The only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast. But on a latest update build PI.4316 miracast is included and now its perfect.To sum up:--------------------Overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of it\\'s average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point. Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across India.New brands like iFFalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. But when it comes to service centres, it\\'s a dead end.I am very much satisfied with the purchase.,It\\'s good product,Good,if you like a best tv on your budget I\\'ll recommend you this stunning picture quality and DTS surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and Miracast is not good 🙁,Build quality good.sound and bass excellent.,Product is very good. Sound quality is crisp. Worth buying. I brought it 2 years back. Still working fine,Good quality Looks durable Charging is fine tooNo complains,Charging is really fast, good product.,Till now satisfied with the quality.,This is a good product . The charging speed is slower than the original iPhone cable,Good quality, would recommend,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/81---F1ZgHL._SY88.jpg,Product had worked well till date and was having no issue.Cable is also sturdy enough...Have asked for replacement and company is doing the same...,Value for money Easy to use,It\\'s good and useful,Had been using this for quite sometime. Supports dual bands. Signal coverage is yet like others. Good use. Easy to install and use,Excellent product revived by old laptop.,,I got this product because for some reason my laptop\\'s internal WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working. Now there are options to buy two separate devices but this solves my purpose and it doesn\\'t sticks out as well.It\\'s having Dual WiFi but I will suggest you to use on 5GHz as the 2.4GHz is a bit slow, slower then the regular 2.4GHz.,It\\'s a good device, good strength, plug and play so no installation needed,BUT got a defective device first which malfunction immediately on plugging, Replaced it with a new one and it\\'s been working well.,Using it for a couple of months now. This has proved to be the much helpful adapter I needed when I moved my PC from Wired to Wireless in a different room. Getting speeds of 148-149Mbps in my 150Mbps subscription speeds. Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It\\'s great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item. Charging power is very less. It takes hours to charge even a single phone.,Ok type product. Not very sturdy,Although it is written fast charging. However it charges quite slow compared to original chargers, even when one mobile is charged at one time.,When using a regular cable, it takes about 2 hrs for a full charge. When using this cable to the same socket and charger, it showing 10 hrs.,IPhone charger last for two months only,Charging not fast,Slow charging4500amh battery18 watt Charger4 khant full charge,Slow charging speed good quality tool from d linkWiFi signal is good,Nice product,Overall good and a better experience,It funcions properly and useful to me.,I you want to buy it for CP Plus Orange DVR, it works.,Nice,Its not plug an play u need to install the driver and will support till 2.4 Ghz not above that. Im using in Jio wifi so its not supporting 5G connectivity as its 3.0,The first reason I bought this item was to have a surveillance camera in my house. To view it on my mobile Used,etc.... I am using it for 14 days now. The experience is pretty good as of now. Picture quality is also not bad. Don\\'t expect something out of the world at this price point. But you can go for it if you have a tight budget.,Initial impressions: works as said, glad I didn’t go for cheaper options (not that it’s too costly) just plug and play. Will update if it screws up,The hdmi cable is good to watch movie,sports and its gives better quality while connecting your laptop with TV and play 🎮.I loved it,Works as expected. Length of the cable is short and it was mentioned also satisfied my requirement. If you need more length better look other options.,All good,It\\'s the best HDMI cable at this price range. No problems yet. Just go for it !!,I was expecting this to be delivered on time and it was delivered on time.Product is good as i have tried other cables and wires from Amazon basica brand.,Good one Overall replacement of original samsung remote.its compatible easily with my samsung uhd tv.but there is no voice command in the remote.,Works well. Will comment on durability after using it for a few months.,It uses two AA battery.Seems durable.,Product quality of good. But the channel button doesn\\'t work. I did return and replaced the same product, but it\\'s th same result, channel button doesn\\'t work,Good to go with this rather than purchasing a original one from samsung,we have an expensive samsung TV.TV is great but original remote started draining battery and we had to put in new battery every 5 days which was not ideal.replacing with original remote is a costly affair ( 4k ?)this is a good cheap replacement- has all the functionalities except voice (which we rarely use),Everything works fine except number keys which is very important to change channels , what a waste of money had to buy another remote,Like the design ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon’s own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn’t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn\\'t also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it\\'s mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one. I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren\\'t available and the replacement B43 drivers don\\'t allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for \"morrownr/8821au-20210708\" and use the driver on Github. I\\'m using the product \"TP-Link AC600\" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don’t support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product. ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon’s own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn’t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.)

It cost should be under Rs. 500,Buy it,Color is as per the photo but takes longer to charge. Also doesn’t charge on all sockets.Seems to work better when plugged in directly in the laptop.,Length of the cable is long so that you can happily use it for long distance as week and quality is really good,1 meter pInk charging wire for iPhone X long and strong one for use..,I have been using this lighting cable for almost a month now and the cable turned out exactly as it was shown. I took the rose gold one that matches my phone’s color. Although the metal ends of the cable was rose gold, but the whole cable was pink, which I didn’t like. I went for the 2m long cable so that i can use it conveniently even if it is charging. Though it’s kinda bulky, yet serves it’s purpose. Charging speed is fast and efficient just like the original cable had. Also quite durable and sturdy. My Apple’s original lighting cable had some problem while charging so I purchased this one after watching many YouTube videos and reviews. It was indeed a good purchase.,It’s long and good,It’s a superb product in terms of sturdiness, looks, and charging speed. I got this for 6k. At this price point, I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn\\'t expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn\\'t have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall, I\\'d say, for a small room, it\\'s a 7/10.,Value for money, Satisfied with the product till now,This Led tv low budget Good 👍 Performance but picture & audio not good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QvXYP2McL._SY88.jpg,Good,Tv is great but the installation guy asked me for 400₹ paid installation... Misleading information but again for this price it\\'s good tv. Don\\'t pay installation guy you can do it yourself,,I will give it 4 stars out of 5. I bought this 32 inch VW at 6150 after discounts. Picture quality and sound quality is good.I added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv. The connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvs.So far, working as it should.Revising this after 9 days, the tv is not responding to switch off button. This is happening more when i watch the tv for a few hours and then when i switch off the tv with the firestick remote, the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red, instead it remains yellow. As far as screen is concerned, the tv\\'s screen changes to black whitish, seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode. This is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red. i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees, then i should get a replacement as i got still 2 days time to replace it.Just a helping note for people buying this tv: if you are going to connect firestick to it, as it asks for the brand name of the tv, you can select VU and it will perfectly work on your firestick. Thanks and enjoy! quality is ok ok only,Well go for it good cable,Useful product in this price.,Very nice,Good,Charging speed supports up to 25V,Product quantity is excellent but very slow charging,Cable is absolutely good looking , strong , durable. But not support fast charging as I expected , I checked speed with stopwatch , I am using Realme phone , with my original realme 20w charger and original cable the time takes to charge 68% to 69% is 34 sec. But with this ambrane cable it takes 1 min 32 sec to charge from 69% to 70%.Little disappointed with charging Speed , overall product is goodHope this review help you guys ! The button contacts are not very good.,Doesn\\'t look as standard and durable as original product,Purchased from Seller: Smart Place Store;Remote works but low build quality. Not original.,Material is very average,Works as described,Not meet expectations,but O K.,It\\'s a good product.,Parts are likely to break even in case of small fall. I use this to connect an old PC to internet. I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn\\'t have to do any setup. There\\'s an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you\\'ll have range problems if you\\'re not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires. Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone\\'s battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don\\'t need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV. I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It\\'s average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I\\'ll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don\\'t have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it\\'s very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I\\'m ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I\\'m very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it\\'s been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I\\'m having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don\\'t have a aux cable so I\\'m not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won\\'t work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won\\'t connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it\\'s a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it\\'s been 4 months and it\\'s super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that\\'s all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I\\'m happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good. Good,Got a nice product,Quick not charger🤏,Cable is very good and looks durable but the pins quality are not good, infact iPhone pin keep coming out even with small movement, You can drive and charge simultaneously. Type C is good and the other pin is very hard to insert but workable.,This not a fast charger and can’t be used for data transfer. Multiple mobile can’t be charged at a time,This works as expected. It is working for both my Samsung phones and the lightning cable also works perfectly..,I loved this product for my car. It\\'s long and quite valuable for charging three mobiles together in one go.,GOOD PRODUCT. Working fine,very good this data cable,Performance of this product is good enough.,Have been using it since quite a well. It is doing an excellent job. You can also avail the warranty by just messaging the serial number on whatsapp. Super happy with the overall performance.,Good data cable same as shown in pic. I brought this for my Nikon d5600 photos transfer to system.,Superb product...👌👌👌,Better,Seems to fast charge at 2A , not tried anything higher, but its a very sturdy cable should last for a long time Nice,Works very well with Airtel DTH. The pairing is as same as every Airtel DTH remote. All the buttons works properly.,Nice,Good substitute for original. Nice product,ok,Poor quality! Stopped working in a month,This remote will work only for the new TV and not able to connect even follow all the procedure mentioned on guide.,You need to sync with original tv remote to make volume, power, mute and av buttons work. You can Google the same its very easy. Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\\'t perfectly black - and they\\'re brighter than you\\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\\'t produce the contrast you\\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\\'t even use your phone\\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\\'d say I\\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\\'t change my decision. It\\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec\\'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don\\'t have voice recognition. I don\\'t require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It\\'s clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product i am writing this review after 2 months, the first cable had a cut and had to be replaced, the second cable is working fine, no issues, using it to charge me PS3 controller, works fine, at a good price, planning to pick up another one as a spare.,Product OK.,I bought this cable to charge my 10w Bluetooth speaker and its working as expected.,It\\'s lengthy and usable for car dashcam.Quality is average and micro type B end does sit very tight.Otherwise, it\\'s all good.But keep checking price of amazon basics cable of this type , price drops many times. That\\'s better quality.,This is one of the good product in this price range. Quality is okay,Using it for my laptop cooling pad. Overall build looks sturdy, but longevity cannot confirm. Also, YOU CANNOT CONNECT 2 PCs USING A MALE TO MALE USB. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. Stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was NOT intended for.Can confirm that it is ~1.2m as most other products and not 1.5m as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the product.No review mentions this. But I needed a 1.5m length for perfect use. So disappointed as I have to rotate the cooling pad and use it (cable falls short by around 15cm).,It works well. The cable is soft and flexible. In all probability, it will last long also.,But pover quality Not too good not too bad,If you have the trust of Amazon basics then go for it. I am writing this review after using it for 18 months. Still as sturdy and durable as the new one.,Nil,Used it for a fortnight till now in my car for mobile charging. Works well.,Not working with Fast Charger , if you are planning to use with normal charger , its pretty good . Product quality too its GOOD.,I\\'m using this cable since 1 years and currently this cable is running perfectly without any problems.If you want to buy best type-c cable then without thinking buy it.,Does not support display only work to connect network and charging,Good and useful Worth the price. I use the local cable providers set up. With my previous tv (Samsung) I was not facing this problem.  The only problem I am facing is each time I turn off the tv from the mains, I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don\\'t know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years. Bought this tv with 2 year warranty on panel.,improve the software response and improve the picture quality. worth for money for this budget (4K).,I have used 2-4 days. Picture quality looks good and impressive. Go for it..Hope long-term quality is also good.,This tv is very good but in this one thing bad is tha this tv some time get stop while playing only YouTube video but otherwise it\\'s a good product,It’s good and value for money,Amazing pic and sound quality. 4K quality at this price. It\\'s really good . I am using it for 14 days now. The experience is pretty good as of now. Picture quality is also not bad. Don\\'t expect something out of the world at this price point. But you can go for it if you have a tight budget.,Initial impressions: works as said, glad I didn’t go for cheaper options (not that it’s too costly) just plug and play. Will update if it screws up,The hdmi cable is good to watch movie,sports and its gives better quality while connecting your laptop with TV and play 🎮.I loved it,Works as expected. Length of the cable is short and it was mentioned also satisfied my requirement. If you need more length better look other options.,All good,It\\'s the best HDMI cable at this price range. No problems yet. Just go for it !!,I was expecting this to be delivered on time and it was delivered on time.Product is good as i have tried other cables and wires from Amazon basica brand.,Good one Good braided cable. Long length. Quick charge. I m using XR. This cable value for money. But chager apple OEM. Portronics type c to lighting  cable worth.,It’s easy to carry and the build quality is quite ok charging speed to almost equal to original oneGiving this review after 1 month usage,Great fit connector, l shaped connectors are convenient and better than some higher priced products.,good,Best product at this price range go for it🔥🔥🔥 and the software shows product will be genuine 🔥 most recommended braided cable for \\uf8ff products,Wish apple made this product as it is easier to hold the phone while charging,Superb quality and supports good charging speeds. Type c to lightning 20w at this price (250Rs) is a steal deal. Nobody is giving this quality at this price,Good cable available at a decent price of Rs. 312.ProsGood design.L shaped connectors will help keeping phone and power bank together in bag or pocket without causing and damage to the charging pins.Does fast charging and compatible with all fast charging power adapters. Regarding rate I liked very much and reasonable.  Regarding the product Acer Company is manufacturing Computer Monitor and are best in quality.  So that, I prefer this company in buying TV,Its been 1 and half month using this product and have no complaint regarding the product some of its plus points are.1. Picture quality is good with clear sound quality2. We can easily connect any pan drive or otg to this Tv and access your content in tv.And Points in which it need improvement:1. Its does not support some audio format that.2. If we connect smartphone through OTG to TV it doesn\\'t support the same3. Also we always have to use TV remote to start the TV. It doesn\\'t start automatically when we on the swith, we have to press power button on remote each time to start this TV.Overall a very good product.,Picture quality is very good 😊,Bought this TV on amazon sale, value for money at this price, the picture and sound quality was okay, not that bad. If you want to buy a 32\\'\\' TV at an affordable price then go for this one.,Nice,Good,I purchased this tv two days before and now it\\'s running.

Quality of mount is excellent, heavy and sturdy. It has paper manual, with clear steps and tools required for installation. Installation was easy and quick. Happy with this purchase.,55inch to can handle this Previously bought amazon basic USB type A cable and i didn\\'t last long, but this USB C product seems manufactured with high quality materials. Supports fast chagrining, data supply etc. just go for it,Exllent,Very satisfied with this purchase, just like orginal quality . Will buy again in future .,My sister is using this cable to charge her phone and the cable is durable and good enough for my sister\\'s phone. Love it!!,I bought it to use Android Auto on Tata Altroz car by connecting to my one plus nord 2T mobile.I have been using this for more than a week now. It\\'s working perfectly..I am happy with the product so far.,Basic,Great product money worth,No issues It worked well for some days later it is not working , I want it to replace.,Nice,Superb product with white lights at both ends when charging. colour and quality feels very premium..,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u-AB650VL._SY88.jpg,Good,Good Build Quality. Nice Product & Highly Recommended.,Good quality and looks beautiful... I will surely recommend,( After using it for 3 weeks). I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasn\\'t able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 20-90%. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour. Overall, I\\'m very happy with the product.I highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging Type C to C cable.Will update this review if any change is observed. Working well and fast Charing as claimed. Pice is at highside. Good item.,Good working worth of money 💰,It is an awesome cable i got it from Amazon. Do charge my phone in a fast way.,The cable is good in quality and charges fast , got it in good deal in the sale .,It\\'s not a fast charger. It says fast charge but it takes forever to charge. But the wire is strong and durable.,Super fast,Charging very fast👍Good product 👍,Works for both DASH and WARP Charging. Good build quality. Worth the price. I use the local cable providers set up. With my previous tv (Samsung) I was not facing this problem.  The only problem I am facing is each time I turn off the tv from the mains, I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don\\'t know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years. Bought this tv with 2 year warranty on panel.,improve the software response and improve the picture quality. worth for money for this budget (4K).,I have used 2-4 days. Picture quality looks good and impressive. Go for it..Hope long-term quality is also good.,This tv is very good but in this one thing bad is tha this tv some time get stop while playing only YouTube video but otherwise it\\'s a good product,It’s good and value for money,Amazing pic and sound quality. 4K quality at this price. It\\'s really good . Liked the product.  Accurate to my usb apparatus.,Good value,Till now i had purchased about 20 cables both micro and c type for myself and my family in this last one year. Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price,na,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that, i am sure it is not very durable. the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex. the wire will break before the connector does!!warning: usb micro connector has a strong hook. be careful while plugging and unplugging, or you may damage your device.very cheap and usable cable for 120 rs,Super power,Nice product.,In this price this is the best one Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand\\'s inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you\\'re conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I\\'m using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I\\'ve been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. 👍🏻,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it\\'s super product and 3 year\\'s of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one. This wire has a good build quality and can do 65 watts (6.5a). Product is good , and also it\\'s  strudiness .But no fast charging in this cable , it\\'s normally charging . I love it because it\\'s supported in micro usb , or type c . Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it\\'s okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel. I need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank. Will recommend.,Best cable,good,Both Micro USB & Type C mobile connector\\'s are getting charge.Good Decision to purchase this product.,Cable is a good fibre braided with good length.The connector also has a tight fit, sometimes you have to apply a bit force to remove(ig it\\'ll wear off after usage).In comparison, boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pin.,I like the product bcuz it\\'s help me to charge both phone Type C & Micro Cabel Everything is fine but it is bulky and hard, it should be softer and thinner.....,Thank you  Amazon very good charging cable 👍,Good,Good one,quality is good. worth for 150-200 ₹. short but durable.,Very Good product . Satisfied..,This is fast charging C pin USB!You can purchase it.,Nice product at price of below 100 Everything is good. Just one suggestion, when TCL is giving its own channel, then it should have some content. What it does, it will route me to another OTT platform for which subscription will be required to be taken.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mPJN3sH-L._SY88.jpg,I like picture quality, sound,Good,Good,Excellent, very nice.,Almost one month of usage , tv is far better than mi TV. Our 40\" mi horizon edition got complaint 3 times in 2 years of warranty period and finally they didn\\'t replaced, third time display gone  after 2 days of warranty.So never go for mi. TCL picture quality and sound quality is very good. In this price range a must buy product.,Good Packing is good .. they have sent a box for itAlso the quality looks good and decently fast chargingGood product for the price paid,Nice product,nice charging cable for low cost.,Highly recommended,Quite nice cable in this price, charging my iPad smoothly  Go for it,I like the product and resnable precise.,Worth buyinh,Nice Works well on my 4K Amazone fire TV stick as well as 2nd Generation Fire TV Stick.If your original remote is got damaged. Buy this one. But price is a bit high. Should have been available for Rs. 800/-,Liked it and and it suited very well for my fire tv,The representative are very friendly and supportive,Product was good ..Customer service was also good.,It been a month since I started using this product, the product is good but it lags a lot it was the same before but I thought since it is new over time this would get resolved but it’s still the same, it takes time to perform an action most of the times. It not up to the expectation. That is the reason why I am changing the review. Thanks,It works with fire stick lite and to my surprise volume controls are also working which was missing in the original one. Setup is also quick.,working as expected , support is prompt.,This remote is good as expected, shared manual is very simple to follow. I am happy with this product. Looks durable Charging is fine tooNo complains,Charging is really fast, good product.,Till now satisfied with the quality.,This is a good product . The charging speed is slower than the original iPhone cable,Good quality, would recommend,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/81---F1ZgHL._SY88.jpg,Product had worked well till date and was having no issue.Cable is also sturdy enough...Have asked for replacement and company is doing the same...,Value for money Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It\\'s great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item. Overall experience in this price is good.You can change 5 modes of audio.Play Store not support, but their app store has almost all apps, which we uses on tv like Netflix, Prime, YouTube.We can\\'t adjust brightness of tv.,Im giving this review after 6 moths usage,The sound quality was next level,Picture quality also good...,LED is very good but remote is not correct, given bad remote which is not working.,Remote speaker is not. Why? Give me demo for speaker.,Picture quality best and sound,Storage 4GBRam 512MBNot support google playstore,Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711DN0Oa2pL._SY88.jpg Good Stuff... Recommended!!!,Need better quality for changing,Good product,I bought it 7 months. Ago it still working in good condition good 😊,good cable to by in budjet,The cable is of very good quality. Charging speed is good for my Redmi k20 pro which support 27 watt fast charging good thing is that the battery backup improved when charge with this cable I’m really surprise I observed this with many time as I test it with with original cable and result is the same. If this is in ur budget then just buy it don’t hesitate,Reliable, strong,Nil Sturdy packing, good product!,Have used this brand cable for my iPhone and iPad before, so when my wife\\'s Samsung charger cable gave up the ghost in less than 6  months, I ordered this. Braided, visibly high quality cable, unlike the flimsy and highly overpriced OEM cables from Apple and Samsung. I have been using my iPhone cable from Wayona for more than 1 1/2 years and still going strong.  Hope this C cable will give a similar performance,I like Wayona chords and especially the long ones. But I get a slight shock - like a static discharge - when I touch my phone while charging with these two cords. Other cords with same charger are okay.,Ok,Cable looks solid and length is also good.Little bit fast charging I observed for phones like Redmi.It also looks solid so I am expecting it to work for atleast 1 year,build quality and fast charging feature,Unbreakable, good quality,Cable a Nice Product I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage: Continuous, OTT only, no Cable/Dish operator.Average daily usage: 6-8 hours.The TV is a great value-for-money product.Installation: The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.Picture: The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn\\'t look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else\\'s better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn\\'t need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It\\'s exactly like Amazon\\'s remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn\\'t find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn’t faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It’s like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can’t eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it’s good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn’t arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn’t came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn’t got the replacement for the product and it’s totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4 ⭐ for picture quality, 3⭐ for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the \\'so called free\\' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it\\'s pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It\\'s awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can\\'t use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it\\'s a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It\\'s running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it\\'s good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn\\'t happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(₹11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\\'t perfectly black - and they\\'re brighter than you\\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\\'t produce the contrast you\\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\\'t even use your phone\\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\\'d say I\\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\\'t change my decision. It\\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec\\'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don\\'t have voice recognition. I don\\'t require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It\\'s clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product Best quality,The product looks original-like and is perfectly working with my OnePlus 8T. Good Type-C to C buy, recommended over other companies.,its a very good product and yet a reliable and durable cable to get yourself connected,Cable is good and support 65 w fast charging. I am use this cable to my one plus 8t mobile phone. This cable also speed in transfer to data. Cable price is also low. Thanks for seller to provide best quality and durability cable in low price. I am happy for saying this cable is all-rounder.,The product worked  fine for me. Got this at good price,Flexible and toughness is best workAnd also in samsung m31s mobile fast charging,I bought this cable for my nothing phone 1 it\\'s amazing, fast charging is working very well I\\'ve tried this also my samsung mobile, and result was fabulous, thanks,Initial impressions are good. It is supporting ulatra fast charging on my OnePlus 9 pro. Looks durable Charging is fine tooNo complains,Charging is really fast, good product.,Till now satisfied with the quality.,This is a good product . The charging speed is slower than the original iPhone cable,Good quality, would recommend,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81---F1ZgHL._SY88.jpg,Product had worked well till date and was having no issue.Cable is also sturdy enough...Have asked for replacement and company is doing the same...,Value for money Was working fine with window 10 old computer but is not installable with new system on Window 11,Overall very good item,Easy to install ok signal,This was used to accesd wifi connectivity for desk top, and TV, worked fine,👍,like,Good product, satisfied with its performance.,It worked on most devices where driver could be installed, even worked with linux system too but for the reason I bought simply didn\\'t get solved with it.. though not returning it as it worked in my computer without any issues. This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV. I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It\\'s average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I\\'ll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don\\'t have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it\\'s very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I\\'m ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I\\'m very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it\\'s been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I\\'m having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don\\'t have a aux cable so I\\'m not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won\\'t work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won\\'t connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it\\'s a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it\\'s been 4 months and it\\'s super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that\\'s all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I\\'m happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good. Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product As a connector, it does its job fine.,Package arrived on time.. working good. Value for money..,Good buy,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61YX8qeuCgL._SY88.jpg,It\\'s great value, although the wire came folded and i had to untie it and untangle it. It does the job well and for the price it\\'s at, I couldn\\'t ask more.,Nice product with good quality,I\\'m using this since a long time and this never disappoint me .... must buy and good plastic quality 👍,Value for money TV looks fine, however I see some lag while selecting the applications such as Amazon prime etc. I didn’t install any new apps.,Received the TV on time.Good Things about TV and TCL:-1. Quick Response:- After the TV is delivered call the customer care for the installation and within 2 hour technician arrive and installed the TV. After that received call back from the customer care to gather the experience and pinged on whatsapp so that if in future encountered any issue quick help will be provided.2. Quality:- Quality of TV is good and can watch all the contents from the apps in max resolution supported by TV i.e., 1080p.3. Steal deal, during the GIF sale received the TV in 13299 which is just wow price.4. Sound Quality is good.5. Android 11 is good and the extra feature which I find beneficial when compared to my old android 9 tv is the voice search feature which now search the content from another apps also after giving permission which is not working on android 9 tv.6. Bluetooth remote with some extra feature. Bought the TV as already have the TCL s6500 32 inch model back in 2018 when it is launched and tv is working flawlessly and since did not encountered any issue so bought this brand tv again when required second TV.Improvement :-1. Bluetooth remote should have the all apps button on remote instead of TCL menu which my previous android s6500 tv have, due to which have to move with some extra click which is annoying for my parents to use.2. in Bluetooth remote they provide some extra button to move directly to youtube, netflix, tcl channel, prime, guard and media, instead of this some customization be provided so that we can configure the buttons to some others apps as per our personal use. out of these button guard, media and tcl channel are most useless button.3. android tv should come with atleast 1.5gb as with 1 GB variant the tv is little slow and already have many preinstalled tcl apps which we cannot remove so tv experience in little bit slow, however buy the model by knowing this limitation as already using 1.5 GB ram old variant of the same brand.other feature are also these which are cons but those are already mentioned in description and user should be aware of them before buying like one such point is 3.1 star is removed because of point 1 and point 3 as it is not making fluid experience of using android tv when watch all the contents from the apps.,Good for value almost all apps r able to download,Less weight and pretty valuable to the budget... And even customer support also available all time.,Like,Good one for this price. . Thanks to Amazon,Very good product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61fO-pDJVEL._SY88.jpg Working very nice ok,Sahi paise ke hisab se sahi kam karta hai,So, the WiFi adapter is working well as of now. It has a CD for installation. However, it self installed without the CD. But it showed that installation wasn\\'t complete even though it was and asked for security password once again after restarting the laptop.,Its worth for money,Okay, working.,Good,Valuable produc,Good USB Wi-Fi dongle for home and office works Not value for money.. not satisfied,Good,Required Replacement but replaced one is Good,Good pairing and connectivity,Got a used remote. As you can see in the pic, the back button is discolored. Since it is working and we are in an urgent need of a remote, not returning. Sharing so that other people stay aware of this.Edit - Requested a replacement and the replaced one looks good.,Almost look like original. Just the brand markings are missing.Works fine with my TV. Good compatibility.All features works fine and as expected.Bcuz of all this, it\\'s a VFM product to me.,Working fine can buy,It is working but expensive. Remote control should be waterproof . Please make it waterproof. I\\'ll pay even 1500. Product  is nice,Decent charging cable for the price. This does not carry data. Also the retractor is not that great. Within a few uses it stops retracting unless you hold both ends and try to pull. No issues in charging,just received the product, seems good, got a black coloured product, checked all the three types cable head. Durability will be known after the regular use. Seems worth the value.,Good product,This is a useful product ever✅,Every thing ok,Good,क्वालिटी में अच्छा नहीं है पर सही चल रहा है। Good looking amd working fine.,I brought this primarily because my Lenovo Laptop (Windows 11) has only one USB 3 port, no ethernet slot and one c-connector port.While in office immediately after purchase of this TP-Link UE330 3-Port USB Hub and Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, I used this for the ethernet connectivity to my office network.  Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard-disk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs (two numbers) and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. It’s compatible with all. It’s plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I’m working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it’s not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would’ve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn’t make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps. Thanks. Good,,Quality of cable is good and fast charging and customer care support very helpful,Simply the best cable.. works really well with fast charging brick,Don’t buy if you have problem with loose pin…its pin is same as oroginal iPhone pin…but the wire quality is good…if you want to take for that…it just took 2 months for thier pin to break,Awesome charging wire,Awesome quality and fast charging,The product works fine.

Am happy with it.At first they had delivered one remote that didn’t work and then I got a replacement which works as expected. Thank you!,Great 👍,It’s a replica of my old Samsung remote. I have used it for a month now and no issues. Good product.,Works fine with my Samsung smart TV. No issues till now,Does everything the original remote does.,Not a genuine product. Seems brittle and a little tough around the edges. Lighter than original remote probably due to the poorer quality of plastic. But for my usage, that\\'s ok as there are no kids to damage it. I barely use 2-4 buttons in the entire remote (Source switch to HDMI for Chromecast, volume buttons, play and pause).,It works even with older 40 inch Samsung 3D TV with Smart remote one. Pros- xiomi 5a is best in budget-Nice picture quality-Very nice audio output- Full of featureCONS- sometimes tv lags-Sometimes stucksIn this prize range all tv having cons like this.::Overall nice tv,The product in this price range is good but as it is running in Android 12 it lags. I hope after few updates the lags problem will be resolved,Useless product and useless quality. Display issues within 7 months and service center is not upto the mark.

Definitely no!!.,I always buy and recommend Samsung Sony or LG for TV. But, I had a hard budget this time and chose Vu because my friends have been using it for at least 4-5 years without much issues.While the delivery and installation were excellent, and TV on the whole is a decent package which gives good clarity than the rival Chinese TVs and Sound, smart features are poor here.You can connect Bluetooth headphones but no option to disconnect them. I had to pair and unpair everytime.There is no voice command button on remote. Even while using the screen button for voice input, nothing gets recognised. My 3k Fire stick voice recognition was tooo good.,I purchased VU gloled 55 inches TV after suggestion from my techie friends and online study. Technician from amazon came to my home for installation in drunken mode. But I compromised with him due to busy schedule of work. He installed tv with his small screws instead of VU standard wall screws. He did whatever he want. Proper installation was not performed.I just calm down then later i gave a complaint to amazon and VU Customer services. Amazon was not properly responded till now. But from VU side i got a huge response of problem solving. Min 3 to 4 customercare executives spoke with me, finally VU\\'s vice President mr prashanth phoned me and apologized me for inconvenience happened to me. He told drunken technician is not from VU. I feel good for VU\\'s Top level executives have interaction with me. From bottom to top level VUs Team in touch with me for a month to resolve my issue due to i stayed away from home. Before few days back technician came to my home again from vu. He reinstalled my tv in perfect position with dedication. I never expect this much customer friendly behaviour from VU Thank you very much VU. Kudos to VU Team...

Amazon is outright cheating by using the word free in their manuals to attract customers. The TV I bought is great .,Picture quality good but sound can be more clear,Nice picture quality,Sometimes lines comes on screen. Can\\'t knew yet what\\'s the problem. Otherwise all is well. Budget free. Happy for product. One amazing cable for 300 bucks,Ok with charging.

Writing this review after using the tv for more than a week.1. picture quality is good.2. Sound could be better. Dosnt\\' mean its bad.3. connectivity is good.4. No issues with software or hardware till now.Overall a good product in this budget. Once again thanks Amazon and LG.,This is good smart tv,I wanted to get display for my PS4.  I was contemplating between a monitor and TV.  Since,  there is no need to get display with high resolution, I opted for this TV.  I have been using this TV for 3 months now.  Below are my observations when using this TV as a secondary TV or gaming TV.Pros:1.  This TV comes with the software from the bigger OLED TV of LG meaning,  to some extent better upscaling.2.  Since I am using primarily as a gaming TV, I love the Game mode.  You can truly see the difference when you play with and without Game mode.  Pic and responses are shaper and faster with Game mode active.3.  You can connect Bluetooth headset to TV.  Great when watching movies as a secondary option.4.  LG service is the best!!!  The come probably the next day,  install the TV (wall mount) for free - Really quick and clean.Cons:1.  No headphone Jack on the TV2.  You can connect a Bluetooth headphones to the TV.  However, for gamers,  the game mode is disabled when TV sound output is through headphones.  However, there is a work around for this.,,It is a good product from LG in range of 15k.Pros:1. Bluetooth support for my wireless earphone2. Audio output is enough for room size of 12×12.3. Wall mount installation is free of cost from LG.4. Smart remote in this range is really appreciable from LG. Doubt samsung provide smart remote this in this range.5. Picture quality is decent.,,,I love LG product and happy to buy this product with 15.5K. It\\'s very good smart TV  with amazing features consist of Good processor, Smart Remote,  Good LCD screen and sound quality is also good.Recommended to purchase. Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand\\'s inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you\\'re conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I\\'m using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I\\'ve been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. 👍🏻,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it\\'s super product and 3 year\\'s of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one. This wire has a good build quality and can do 65 watts (6.5a). Good product,Good,Nice product, fits exactly.,Good product,Fantastic remote cover to buy. It fits the LG 2022 model\\'s UQ80 as well...A very good product.,Done the job but value high.,Product isn\\'t bad, but the rate is very Expensive.,Nice It\\'s awesome product. Fast mobile charging cable. I like it.,Good product just wish it was available in black white gets dirty easily.,For a month I had no issues with this, then it started becoming more and more useless. Don\\'t buy it. It looks alright but it is as bad as a local cable. My phone charges slowly, have to disconnect and connect the cables from the ports and reassemble them and still it would reduce the battery. I haven\\'t used a worse cable. Very disappointing and money waste. Also, the packaging was open and not sealed when I recieved it. The seller is a fraud.,Little more grip should be given while plugin out on type-C pin side.so, it can smoothly remove instead of sudden out with little jerk.,first of all it has \\'L\\' shaped port for easy to use while on charge as i\\'am using it for my car for android auto.over-all its excellent.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UCbJvmdmL._SY88.jpg,Realme 6 30W fast charging adapter. Its a slow charging cable vooc not support,Though they call it as fast charging cable, it actually is NOT a fast charging cable.I tried it with my samsung fast charging adapter. Its a slow charging cable, but the look, sturdiness etc are impressive.Planning to return the product. Sometimes the remote gets disconnected with the device automatically.,Press home button for 10-20 sec, it is working smoothly like the original.,Not value for money,Not working.not even three months,Value for money.,Submitting after almost 10 days of use. Volume button doesn\\'t work from day 1. Rear battery cover is lose and can fall off anytime. Other functions on the remote like Alexa voice commands, menu, home button, scrolls work fine.,Works fine. Wrong instructions..a bit too expensive. Does the job.,I liked It A Alot,Nyc Remote,Just like Original Slow charging, charging speed is not fast,Not happy with this product bcoz this is a highly priced as compared to its quality and the wire is not actually retracted easily. Need to push in byhand.Scrumbles within the case. Not recommended,It doesn\\'t support Apple car play connectivity. Good quality. BUT 👎When winding down the cable most of the times gets entangled.,Usefull,charges, but doesn\\'t support Apple car play,Built in quality of plastic roll could have been better,Useful, 3 types  in one time charging,The device gets tangled easily if you don\\'t reel it in and out with both ends tangential to the housing reel. Otherwise it is a compact and useful device to have in your car. i am writing this review after 2 months, the first cable had a cut and had to be replaced, the second cable is working fine, no issues, using it to charge me PS3 controller, works fine, at a good price, planning to pick up another one as a spare.,Product OK.,I bought this cable to charge my 10w Bluetooth speaker and its working as expected.,It\\'s lengthy and usable for car dashcam.Quality is average and micro type B end does sit very tight.Otherwise, it\\'s all good.But keep checking price of amazon basics cable of this type , price drops many times. That\\'s better quality.,This is one of the good product in this price range. Quality is okay,Using it for my laptop cooling pad. Overall build looks sturdy, but longevity cannot confirm. Also, YOU CANNOT CONNECT 2 PCs USING A MALE TO MALE USB. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. Stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was NOT intended for.Can confirm that it is ~1.2m as most other products and not 1.5m as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the product.No review mentions this. But I needed a 1.5m length for perfect use. So disappointed as I have to rotate the cooling pad and use it (cable falls short by around 15cm).,It works well. The cable is soft and flexible. In all probability, it will last long also.,But pover quality i like the made of the product but it doesn\\'t support fast charging  and it dont connect to android auto in car.,Great,Connectors are compatible. Charging power delivery depends on the adapter used. Build quality is good. Suitable lenght.,3 leads working,user friendly for car drives,Doesn\\'t charge proper, tried all possible ways. It is so slow and can support only one device at a time.,Quality, toughness and power supply are giving you the best 👌 👍.,Product is superb, Cable is durable and thick nylon string is used.3 pins are most useful.My 5000 mah mobile battery can charge in 2 hrs fully. Other devices can charge early.While charging no device\\'s are hitting. Good cable. got original product and it is durable and light weight,Quality is top notch and also tough as hell very much durable and charges the devices just like the original brand cable. Never have to worry about wear and tear of cables.,Fast charging, built quality super,Using to charge I phone X with Samsung 25 watt charger, it works fine, charges the phone in 90 minutes,  lets see how long it lasts , till now no issues,100% Original Product from Belkin,Works absolutely fine,,Much Better Quality than Apple with Fast Charging Support.. Some buttons not working in first week of purchase. Quality not upto the mark.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YEe372yJL._SY88.jpg,Works as expected.,Good product with great compatability with firestick,Liked the utility, build and finish,It\\'s not working moreover not being able to initiate return/refund after so many tries,एक दम मस्त चलरहा है,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QADVOkXnL._SY88.jpg Tv is good as such, there are multiple issues for it, you get what you paid for so not going to brag about it. Picture looks crisp, sound is awful, light weight, flimsy legs and body, tv looks frame less unless you turn it on. This tv doesn\\'t support Pre Video out of the box, reaching out to Customer care will easily resolve the issue. There are noticeable lag while casting/ screen share. Overall the product is good for small office, shop or casual streaming for Bedroom or kitchen.,5 star.,Good product,Value for money,Good,The product is good. In this price you can get the best product,Processor very slow plg improve,Smart work is slow but picture sound ok 👍🏻 Hi all, firstly, I was very skeptical to purchase TV through online. Secondary, Iam a big fan of Sony and LG brands., Thirdly,as I have 4 year old kid at home I was so scared to spend money beyond 15k. Ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the Amazon great Indian festival started, I saw one Plus and Hisense A6H were priced at under 20k including bank offers and my favourite Sony 43inch was priced at 35k. But discarded Sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it. So I was continuously searching for budget friendly TVs like TCL, Redmi Nokia and Iffalcon but didn\\'t like the 32 inch TV. Suddenly out of the blue on Thursday that is on 20 October I saw this blowing offer on Hisense Vivid 4K TV but scared to buy, but I felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for 15,740/- ( deal price 20,990... ICICI Bank credit card instant discount 5,250/-) so technically bought it for 15740/- so I felt worth the risk and bought it. On 22nd October TV was delivered to me and immediately I raised installation request and technician came on 23October and installed the TV.That\\'s my journey from searching to installation.Now coming to initial impressions.1- Picture - I\\'d say being a VA Panel, I can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind, however, colours are not over saturated, I felt they are normal and when I looked at TV from sides I can clearly say it doesn\\'t come near to IPS panel display. But, yeah for an average user like me it\\'s sufficient.2- Remote- It\\'s simple, major apps hotkeys are given. YT, Amazon prime video, Hotstar which is good. voice assistant is enabled. Simple and user friendly experience. It lacks hands free Google assistant.3- Sound- I personally felt if 30 Watts audio given in the TV it would have been great, but only 24watts given which is crisp and clear though I increased volume upto 70 to chk, but no distortions nothing it\\'s clear dialogues and Bass, but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage.4- UI- It comes with Android 9 it doesn\\'t matter to me as I\\'m a very average user so runs the show for me, I hope Hisense sends the OTA update5-Now to the main point as u can see my pictures, I see specially in Amazon prime video app, on the blue screen there are some lines which I don\\'t know whether it\\'s problem with panel or application. Need to chk with Amazon customer service for the reason. If any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super.6- Conclusion - Frankly speaking i bought this TV only bcz I got it almost under 15000(bought for 17520/- including extended warranty for 2+2 years) bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it won\\'t pinch me . So from my perspective I felt it\\'s okay with some minor issues like sound. I just need to get clarity on that prime video issue. If that is sorted I will be happy.Happy Diwali to team.,I have bought this tv at 18,990.00 and at this price tag its a great purchase.picture quality is good not at per with sony or lg 4k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi VU etc. VA Pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacks.Pros:Android TVSoundColourCons:Remote,Loved the picture quality,Average picture quality but ok for this price,Worth for the cost. Nice quality and clarity,Good,Good product,Good support team as unit reached within 11 hours installation done within time of installer called. Demo properly given. And company call also received in 3 days for confirmation of material delivery and installation done proper way . Worth the price. I use the local cable providers set up. With my previous tv (Samsung) I was not facing this problem.  The only problem I am facing is each time I turn off the tv from the mains, I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don\\'t know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years. Bought this tv with 2 year warranty on panel.,improve the software response and improve the picture quality. worth for money for this budget (4K).,I have used 2-4 days. Picture quality looks good and impressive. Go for it..Hope long-term quality is also good.,This tv is very good but in this one thing bad is tha this tv some time get stop while playing only YouTube video but otherwise it\\'s a good product,It’s good and value for money,Amazing pic and sound quality. 4K quality at this price. It\\'s really good . It\\'s really worth it . I am using it to get output on another display from my laptop through this wire. Till now it\\'s really good and build quality is really good.,I had problem with my last hdmi cable as anyone at home switch on/off any switch my desktop display goes off  for a secWith this dp to hdmi it\\'s all good my problem has gone .,Excellent Product and Service . Value for Money,This cable is very useful if your CPU has display port out & monitor has HDMI port in. Other way, it won\\'t work. Cable is of good quality. Best packaging by Amazon.,Nice product,My PC has an HDMI port while my LG monitor has. DP port.. My monitor doesn\\'t detect this as a valid input signal when using this converter. A normal DP to DP port connection works just fine ... It is hence important to note that the cable might not work universally.,6ft display to hdmi cable working fine very good at 500 inr.,The product is good. Long enough for my PC setup. I didn\\'t experience any loose connection with this yet. Been using it for almost 4months.You can go for it. Seems OK. Have not tried it with HD quality videos. Value for money.,Very high and in budget hdmi cable by amazon basic,Nice,I bought this for my android tv stick and it works very good with it.Quality of the cable is very good and rich.It doesn\\'t lose the picture and sound quality of TV stick,It is working as expected,I purchased splitter but it didn’t work properly and ordered for hdmi male female wire which helped me to view sources properly,Good. Serves the purpose. Had to buy this as for some weird reason the amazon firestick (bern working for 3 years) is no longer working when connected to my Samsung TVs HDMI port (all 4 ports). Searching in google did not help as this issue seem to be common with Samsung TVs but with no possible solution. So wanted to check if the firestick works in my computer monitor but the HDMI slot in the monitor was unreachable for a direct connection and hence bought this cable. The firestick worked well with monitor. What\\'s even weirder is the firestick works fine when connected to the same Samsung TV using this cable. Problem solved, although no clue how the hell it got fixed :),The quality of this cable is quite good. Been using it for a couple of months now, to connect a laptop or a desktop to a Dell monitor. Picture quality for Full HD works fine along with sound output, not sure about 4K though since I don\\'t have a 4K monitor. Price should be less than Rs. 250 which I paid, should be in the Rs. 100/- to Rs. 150/- considering the quality and other alternative products available in the brick and mortar stores. If you are willing to pay a bit extra then this is just fine. Apart from dispatch of the item by Amazon the ifalcon smart TV is a good buy for the value of money. Picture is crystal clear enjoy it with high speed internet.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515glvxKxSL._SY88.jpg,Good in Smart TV but low sound quality.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AnTT6yIoL._SY88.jpg,,At 8k it\\'s worth , value for money.Good picture quality and sound.Satisfied Customer. 👍👍👍,Value for money product is ok as per price,Good picture quality, sound as well My LG smart 4K TV’s magic remote went kaput and since LG’s magic remotes are super pricey I decided to give this one a try. Besides the air mouse and motion gestures everything else works absolutely fine.Also the lightweight remote and its form factor feels really nice and cozy in hands. However the buttons have no dots or rivets over its buttons which sometimes makes you forget which key you are pressing.Other than that its a great remote controller.,This product is good for work from my box TV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XuQNA3jRL._SY88.jpg,After having my original magic remote go kaput, I was not sure if this remote would work on my 55inch LG smart TV. However, a huge relief, it works and works like a smooth operator using the keys.  No need of any set up etc. It doesn\\'t have voice or scroll button, but I anyways was not using that feature in my original magic remote, since that consumes batteries to a great extent forcing you to change batteries every 4 days. Don\\'t waste money buying expensive ones, go for this.,Functionally very good, and it is a good replacement for the original remote, on which the power switch had stopped working. I haven\\'t had to use most of the other functions.,Good performance,Cheap and best alternative for your lg remote. Magic mouse option is not there but works fine with my lg tv,Works as expected. The response is little slow but that\\'s still fine. Made up of good quality material....No issue till date..... value for money,I checked many products in amazon, this is very nice product,Used to connect mixer to my Obage dt 31 tower speakers, gives best sound quality,I USE IT TO CONNECT MY ZEBRONICS 5.1 SOUND SYSTEM TO MY PC & YEAH IT DOES THE JOB REALLY GOOD!!!!,Nice,Using with sub,The cable is good, connectors are also strong. But price is too high.,Working just as fine as 1.5M cable that my speaker company has provided. Good Quality, Gold pleted. Premium looks. About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the \\'so called free\\' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it\\'s pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It\\'s awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can\\'t use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it\\'s a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It\\'s running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it\\'s good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn\\'t happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(₹11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money Material os very good, initially charges very fast but after 7 months saw a diffrence in speed, I contacted seller for warranty, within 1 day they delivered me new one without any cost.Great product  good service.,Costly but good product,Wire can be a bit soft..it is very hard to get it fold,Product is good but I need replacement asap. Cause it\\'s stopped working.,The cable is physically resilient and looks good too. The cable stopped working in 7 months - contacted customer support and they ensured a replacement soon. All in all, a hassle-free warranty claim.Shall share an update once I get the replacement.,Very sturdy cable, best fit for rough n tough use.,Very nice cable,Very good product The color is not same as what is shown in images. Rest, the quality is good.,Go for it,,, ,,it is useful and strong also. But buy in sale or discounted price only.best for daily use. Bit be alert from delivery man of dtdc of amazon. Even they are ready for anything like Gundas.,Using from several months. Very good product. If you want to avoid the cable this is a best product.,Eco Dot 3rd,Product does its work but quality can be improved. Edges are not smooth and is made of poor quality plastic. No shine but dull outlook. Still ok to buy in this price.,The product correctly holds the Echo Dot as well as the cables without hindering the flat placement on the wall. The position of the holder can be shifted slightly as well (in terms of distance from the wall) because the holder can slide on the adapter. These are the biggest pros for the product as for the cons, the product could improve on the plastic quality and texture.,Quality need to improve but not bad happy to purchase,if your power outlet is not going to hold the charger stronger, don\\'t go for it.. it might fall down The 2 in 1 charger is very much useful as there are still people who uses micro usb as well as c,Nice cable 👌🏼  2 in 1 , budget product and durable,Good,I am not satisfied 🙈,Quality of product is good. Fast charging supported. Cannot use with wall chargers as the length is short. Good to use with Powerbank and laptops.,Justifying price,Wire size too small,not woking prodact amazon isuss cebals bad prodactsi i am nit use this prodatcs not retun track pleess pikup prodacts https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SaXlf9TZL._SY88.jpg,Small cable otherwise good,,I like the product.,Quality is good but after a month immediately I lose 9% of battery health so that’s why I stop using it,Not sturdy, cable will break in just weeks,i suggest this product,Nice There\\'s no magic remote and lg should include it by default as it makes life easier. The magic remote costs around 3k approximately.Display: when turned on tv and tested the display on black wallpaper found very small green and white dots.Immediately called up Amazon first and then we scheduled a tech visit.The tech did not come rather spoke on call and asked what\\'s the problem and when informed about the problem he said needs to be replaced but no body came with it.So i waited for 2 days again and nothing was showing up on Amazon app about replacement so doubting it I called up Amazon customer care again and explained everything again and finally spoke to some one and she said she will get it replaced and i was given another date within 4 days.This time the replacement came and was good.,Amazing picture quality and sound clarity, but only drawback is that it did not come with a Magic remote.,The television is good but the installation service is pathetic first of all they did not contact us till 2 days after the TV delivery and we got frustrated and call LG customer service and they accepted our problem and send a technician after 2 hours and while installing the mount he installed 3 bolts successfully but he broke the last bolt and we asked him will it not cause a problem in future he said it wouldn\\'t but we don\\'t really believe him.,Good,Very nice good quality best in this price,Nice choice,Best deal,I like LGWorth for price. Very good It\\'s a good data cable and I recommend it to purchase,the only issue was the metal pin is not fixed firmly so it has become loose,otherwise no issue,must purchase,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SgnWv1ML._SY88.jpg,Charging cable which is sturdy it\\'s not a fast charging cable but the three outlets does the job.,Good sturdy micro usb cable with good charging speeds. Please don\\'t raise prices,Nice product, a simpla microusb cable,😂,Best for this price,Good one Absolutely value for money. I connect it with my Samsung 55 inch UHD TV, JBL 3.1 soundbar and Jio set top box. All is working zakkaass !! Picture quality improved compared to my earlier cable. Now getting Dolby 5.1 with this set up. Thumbs up for this item.,Best product at fair price. Quality of the cable is too good.,Must buy picture clearity upto the mark The remote looks very similar to the original one. Doesn’t need any specific setup and is already tuned to the Sony Bravia LED TV of ours.,Perfectly working,Working fine so far,Best remote in the market. I am using and controlling SONY Smart TV. Easy to use. Working smoothly till date.All functions are working. Best replacement remote in competitive price.,Doesn\\'t perform like an original.,Reasonable product but of not good quality,Like expected all required functions work without any issues. Remote itself is made of high quality plastic, not sure how many years it will last but build quality look and feel sturdy.,It’s working but buttons are not good. One amazing cable for 300 bucks,Ok with charging. Looks very sturdy and durable.,Fast charging upto 25watts 2m in length and really durable.Bought it like the 4th time passed down my older cables to family members all still in working state.,I bought it in 2019 and it almost last three years post heavy usage... Gonna buy it again! Very good quality,Good quality USB C Charging cable that enables Fast Charging for Samsung M21 as well as M33 5G 24 W seeking phones. 2 metre cable length helpful in keeping phone on desk while Charging Adaptor plugged into Electric Outlet. Best value. Similar 2 m cable costs 3x or 4x in retail market. This is best price,Great product. Wanted this as my Portable battery has USB slot and iPad and Kindle Reader have USB-C ports. Fits my requirement perfectly. Charges very fast.,good,Very good overall The product was nice its charging awesome,Cant say anything about durability and sturdiness as the part which gets connected to adapter seems to be in a highly vulnerable state. With a flick of hand it might get bent as my last charging chord got to be so i had to buy this one. Something must be done about that.,Very good worth the money,I had to replace the cable that I had recieved with my laptop. I opted Zoul and am highly satisfied by the cable. It\\'s durable and works seamlessly.,This is an amazing product from Zoul. I bought many other cables before from other brands but they didn\\'t work that well. But this, I must say is the Best of all in terms of charging power, durability and sturdiness. Much Recommend!!,I\\'ve been using this cable for over 6 months with my Galaxy S22 it\\'s been working flawlessly. Fast charging works as expected and the 2m length makes it convenient to use it in bed. Would recommend to anyone looking for a long cable. Infact, my brother purchased one after seeing me buy it.,The cable has good length, charges very fast, I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren\\'t available and the replacement B43 drivers don\\'t allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for \"morrownr/8821au-20210708\" and use the driver on Github. I\\'m using the product \"TP-Link AC600\" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don’t support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product. TV remote is the replica of the original one supplied with TV. The original one served for about one and half year. The remote came without any battery. Performance since last few days is satisfactory. But Amazon has similar remote with lessor price. But can\\'t asses the quality. Alternatively one can operate by downloading the remote from play store in android. But may be little inconvinience to operate.,Working fine but the quality of outer case is low quality. Can be purchase.,The pairing of this remote was little tough and also some times remote is not working after I use the voice Recognition. The buttons are hard to press when compare to the original remote which came with the smart box. So, find a original piece and go for it,Remote is faulty . It looses it\\'s connectivity with the tv atleast 50 times in a day. So I have to pair it 50 times.I want a replacement. Please arrange a call back from the customer service team,,Value for money, sturdy quality, need voice recognition improvement,Must add a note that you must switch on TV manually and then pair,working is good, no issuebut material quality is not up to mark I use this to connect an old PC to internet. I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn\\'t have to do any setup. There\\'s an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you\\'ll have range problems if you\\'re not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires. Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone\\'s battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don\\'t need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity I recently purchased the Kodak TV from Amazon and overall, my experience has been satisfactory. The picture quality is good and the streaming capabilities are convenient. The user interface is easy to navigate, although it did take me a little bit of time to get used to it.However, I do have a few issues with the TV. The sound quality is not the best and I have noticed some lag when switching between apps. These issues do not significantly impact my viewing experience, but they are worth mentioning.Despite these issues, I would still give the Kodak TV 3 stars out of 5. It is a decent TV for the price, but there are certainly better options out there. I was offered an additional 3 months of warranty if I wrote a review, but I am not particularly interested in extending the warranty at this time.It is not appropriate or ethical to write a false or misleading review in exchange for incentives, such as an extended warranty or other perks. Doing so goes against Amazon\\'s guidelines and can lead to consequences for both the customer and the company.It is important to be honest and transparent in your reviews and to only write about your genuine experiences with a product. This helps other customers make informed decisions about their purchases and ensures that the review system remains fair and trustworthy.If you are not satisfied with the Kodak TV or do not feel comfortable giving it a high rating, it is perfectly okay to give it a lower rating or to not write a review at all. It is always better to be honest and genuine in your reviews, rather than attempting to manipulate the system for personal gain.,Issues with chrome casting,I did not believe such a good feature would be available at this price.  I liked the feature of supporting the Ethernet port and earphone jack.,Kodak tv,For the amount being charged, this is a acceptable TV.The Kodak 7XPRO  model is same as Thomson 9A series.Despite being 32\" big, this was lighter than my previous Bravia 18\" TV and easily mounted to the previous wall-mount. Note: The wall mount holes are plasticky and dont have any metal insert.The remote sensor is separate module projecting from the underside of the TV and does not look integrated  with the main body.The two USB ports are side by side which dont interfere with each other.The Audio out port is a good feature if one wants to watch TV without disturbing others.When i first connected the TV to my set-top box over HDMI, there was only picture and no sound.The person at the service center whose number is listed on the TV\\'s warranty card said that they dont support this and i need to call the TV manufacturer. so much for printing a service center number on warranty card.This was fixed after changing the HDMI CEC settings in the set-top box (not TV\\'s fault).There is no user-manual given with the TV. most people, based on their experience with phone should be able to ultimately figure out the connections. The only included leaflet-book (whose pages were all stuck together) talks about the Android menu, There is no info on the TV\\'s input jacks (like what the HDMI ARC stands for).I got multiple calls after the purchase to enquire about delivery and if i needed installation.As i already had a previous wall mount on which this could get attached with no hassles, I opted out of installation service.,All is welllll,Good tv,Picture quality is very good Value of money,Usually  gd,Good Product,Good,Quality is poor and responce is late,This it what you\\'ve been looking for I guess,Quality is okk , not bed it all but it\\'s body is not proper tight or fixed.,The product is of poor quality and seems like duplicate. Remote doesn’t work properly. It works more than expected , little bit lose but other than that it works well till date , it is really long and  that is so much useful,QUALITY IS GOOD.LOVE IT.NO ISSUES SO FAR.,Bought for around 800 rupees. Cable is little bit lengthier (they have mentioned the length of the cable too, so can’t complain it). Overall the product is far far better, best and worth for the penny.,Build quality is great, looks good as well, my last amazonbasics cable lasted around 3 years so I am expecting the similar from this one.,Not supporting for CarPlay. And this product I want to cancel but Amazon don’t have option to cancel.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/C1c42PWPh0S._SY88.jpg,It\\'s sturdy and durable. Using since one month no issues reported...,Nice product by Amazon Basics The cable does support fast PD charging, I have tried it on my laptop, and also tried it on the powerbank.Tested on the Samsung 45watt charger and it worked fine for the phone, tried the same on charger on laptop for PD charging, though it charged the laptop but the cable point does heat up quite a bit. So there are chances that if a 100 watt charger is used, it may heat up a lot. Overall the cord is well make, very sturdy and the materials indicate that this cord will be very very durable. The price would could have been on the lower side due to heating otherwise its a good buy.,Good for buy,Like it,I got this for my samsung s10 lite and it is compatible with super fast charger and charged my phone in Super fast charge mode. Value for money. Could not post picture but product is good. Far better than original Samsung cable which cost almost same.,The cable is sterdy, the ends are premium. Charges my One Plus 7T rapidly. Great data transfers on my Macbook as well. I am happy with the purchase.,Good cable,Worth it. Quality of cable is very good. Supports fast charging in Samsung Galaxy devices,Ideal for charging but not for data transfer.(gives an average speed of 30 to 35mbps with my ssd capable of more than 100mbps transfer speed and actually gives with its provided cable) Using with my Xbox and it\\'s working perfectly,A good upgrade from stock cable which i got from samsung. The sound quality has definitely improved in the soundbar. It is loud enough between 10-15 volume. However the subwoofer output has not improved significantly.,I GOT NORMAL INSTEAD OF PREMIUM CABLE WITH SMALL SIZE. BUT LUCKILY I GET USE TO IT.,Works really well.,Absolutely top class for the money spent. No loss of signal, as good as if there is no splitter involved. Fantastic buy as most TVs have only one optical output.,,Getting proper 5.1 channel surround sound.Channel seperation is great.I\\'m using it in jio setbox with zebronics zuke 9400 pro 5.1 sound bar,Worked as expected with my LG tv Superb,I\\'m using this in my car from 3 months quality of product is as described andIt\\'s Working very good with my redme note 5proQuickly charged under 45 min 0 to 100% 5000mah batteryYou just need fast charger.,The purpose of me using this is not for charging but as an attachment for a portable DAC to mobile for IEMs.> Build quality is really good.> Ends are really premium.> Transfers sound without as such without noticeable loss or additions.Cannot comment on its durability. Will update the same later.,The best you can get.. a bit pricey, but then its not easily available in local market. Thnx to duracell that they have this.. It’s convenient if u hv reverse charging from your phone. I use it for digital lock that we have on our home door..,0k,Yes it\\'s a great product for me! It charges my Samsung galaxy J8 which has a USB port with the new samsung 25W charger which has a Type C port! But be careful as it charges at 15W. It does the job pretty well but it\\'s Made in China whereas the Samsung Charger is Made In India,This thing from duracell meets the expected expectation! No wonder.,Very good quality Vu  UHD SMART 43\"  web os  version good  tv 2022 , picture quality and opareting  nice  , but sound  quality I am not satisfied not afctvive  to other t vs,HDR can’t be turned off in apps,Got it at 19k in the sale. The TV uses WebOS. its snappy. its so so feature rich. The magic remote is amazing. It supports Samsung Smartview and DEX out of the box which means without any internet and wifi etc you can directly cast your screen. Super handy. The sound quality is just so so great for the price. The Remote gets synced with the Airtel DTH and there is dual band support. The HDR gets detected and auto upscaled for Full HD contents in the Hotstar and Netflix. The only cons I find is the power usage which is 100Watt and the smart assistant is pretty useless. The WebOS btw has all essential apps.About VU: Installation is done same day. i cant comment on the durability and future support now. But thats common for all TV comps today except Samsung, LG, Sony and Panasonic.,All fine but remote is a pain. It\\'s too ergonomically faulted for elderly people. Also webos is not the greatest and user friendly.,Good,Really good product overall, bit different from android tv but work almost simler to google or android tv.only feedback is screen mirror feels little bit legging and it would be good if we get mx player in store.,While placing Orders, I asked for Exchange of old Samsung 32” TV, And 2 years Extended Warranty for New TV.  This has Not Come with Delivery.,I like all the features but login for ott apps is a problem which we have to open chrome in mobile or laptop for login in tv Not charging as fast as I\\'d have expected. Maybe something wrong with my unit. However, the cable overall is actually pretty decent. The material is great, it doesn\\'t bend out of shape very easily, and looks (and feels) premium. The length is definitely a plus!,Good,A sturdy cable for mobile charging.,It\\'s been 1 month that i am using this charging cable, works very well with S20 FE 5G. Thumbs up.,Braided cable is sturdy and built well. Long cable adds extra reach and is tangle free.,A good buy. The extra length helps a lot.,Good product,Ok Overall good.,TV picture ok smart betterSound very low another brand,Service provider refuse install my TV, bad service and samsung, I am calling 3 times service provider. Not meet my home address.why ? Bad bad,They product did not come with the support stand or wall hanging hook to install the Tv,Picture quality is very poor in cables,Floor stand does not come with it ... You have to buy it seperately. Request Amazon to cleary mention it in the add . You will have to pay seperate charges for the installation guy to buy the floor mount .,Good, Worth for money - suitable for Android auto... my purpose served in car....got it for Rs.150,Everything is Okay. But packaging is not good feeling like seller gave is used cable.,Good product,Good product but cost is more.,Original cable,I bought this cable at 129. Using this cable for Android auto in my car. Perfectly works without any glitch.,Original MI cable. Will charge upto 33 watts. Got it for Rs 150.  I have 67 watt charger and I want a cable for my car so I went for it. I checked the performance with battery charging app. The charging speed is exactly half of my 67 watt original cable. Go for it.,It provided me turbo charging. I recommend for all Redmi note 10s mobile phones. As it provide turbo charging. I am veri happy with this product.

But when I connect this with pc i was surprised..because of the sound I heard. very poor low quality sound .. maybe because the product I got wasn\\'t same as shown on Amazon.Please spend some extra money for the better one. tv on off not working, so difficult to battery really a bad product Good cable. got original product and it is durable and light weight,Quality is top notch and also tough as hell very much durable and charges the devices just like the original brand cable. Never have to worry about wear and tear of cables.,Fast charging, built quality super,Using to charge I phone X with Samsung 25 watt charger, it works fine, charges the phone in 90 minutes,  lets see how long it lasts , till now no issues,100% Original Product from Belkin,Works absolutely fine,,Much Better Quality than Apple with Fast Charging Support.. This review is for the native FHD projector.Yes, it is a native 1080p led projector. connected this to my desktop computer and tested also. Dont bother trying to play videos from USB. Quality is bad.But when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi, it is actually quite good. I mean picture quality, colours, brightness etc for a sub 10k projector. In this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub 15k ranges.Sound is also pretty much okay, loud enough more like boat 5w speakers, may be a bit more louder not good quality wise. Quitr workable as portable solution, but not for a permanent setup.Audio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also. Meaning 2.1 speakers can be connected to it, for a higher setup, person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itself.From 9ft and 3-4 inches distance of lens to wall, we can get exactly 100 inch(87 inch x 49 inch) projection. So, it can be called as short throw projector, albiet may be border level. There is an option to reduce the screen size upto 75% of original size electronically once connected to HDMI.Keystone correction is not usuable at all. That wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screen.That means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location. Can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction. I. e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels, projector also has to fixed at lower levels only. Best focus can be get, when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably 5 to 6 inch above, so if we flip the projector upside down, we get best focus opposite to center a few inches down.For mysetup, where projecting only 1.5 feet above from the floor, going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down, this way i can fix the projector a bit more above/behind the sofa. I will post the pics later, once it is setup properly.Now the verdict - this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen( look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand) is one of most vfm combo for approx 11k for experiencing a very bright 100 inch screen experience of good quality for 1 or 2 person.  But now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of 15k to 30k, im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projector(look only ANSI value). This buy was more of an impulse purchase, but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projector.Edit: the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel, which impacts the clarity also after a few days. I had to clean the panel myselg just after 1.5 month.  New lesson learnt, apart from high ansi lumen projector, this is also an important factor for future purchase. Planning to get a custom cloth cover made, so that i dont have to clean it often. Though, Lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model. Somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet. Only the lcd has very very fine dust particles inside.,Quality is good, value for Money. Bluetooth Connectivity is smooth and fast. The sound quality of the Projector is not so great but that we had already considered before. Hotstar App really works nicely with great quality, and so does Youtube. Netflix & Prime video doesn\\'t give the same quality initially, but that must be wifi connection. Some apps however don\\'t get installed, or just close on their own.The good point is the Bluetooth connection, and even we have added a Bluetooth soundbar, so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good option.,This is indeed a fantastic product in this price range.it is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through HDMIneedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day i.e. if you can cover up your windows and other light sources.Screen spread is Almost up to 120 inch at a throw distance of 13 to 1 feet with the sharpness more or less intact.converts 4K to 1080PWill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mine.ensure that the walls are white for best image / video reproduction.Definitely recommended at this price point.ConsOnly vertical Keystone correction available,Projector is good so far as it used for last 3 days. May revisit the feedback after a couple of months.,I bought this projector for my classroom and it’s very helpful for their studies. Now students connect themselves more to the world.😊,I feel It\\'s a value for money product as I have already used it for last two months.,If u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further..... THIS IS IT...!!! BEST IN PRICE, GOOD PICTURE QUALITY, BRIGHTNESS AND A DECENT REMOTE WITH GOOD FUNCTIONALITY... As always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs... Very good for family get together, movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity... I\\'ve canceled my dth connection Coz AMAZON PRIME TV STICK WITH THIS PROJECTOR IS ALL I NEED... THAT\\'S ALL THE TIME I HAVE FOR WATCHING TV AMIDST MY WORK AND THEY DO THE JOB WELL... An entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied... Any queries ping me I\\'ll help u as much as i can... Don\\'t worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family man,it will satisfy all ur needs,be it surfing, movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too... Hope it helps...UPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS - 4HRS/DAY USAGE :The pic uploaded was by noon 1pm with dark screens...HI, THIS WAS A REPLY TO A CUSTOMER TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN EGATE I9 N UC 68 & 46,  BUT I THOUGHT IF THIS WAS PUT UP IN UPDATE SECTION A LOT WOULD BENEFIT SO HERE IT GOES...First u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if it\\'s for offic use or home entertainment, also u didn\\'t mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc... since u have not i\\'ll go with a general review for purposes... IT\\'S GOING TO BE A VERY DETAILED REVIEW SO GUYS WITH OUT PATIENCE CAN RUN TO THE END AT ONCE...!!!I too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i9 from uc 68 & 46... Let me tell u what helped me decide...First n foremost egate is an Indian company unlike uc which is a common Chinese product with a namesake brand UC (confirmed it with my friend in China)... Hence service n general trust is more on egate than competition...Secondly, from fellow customers, I\\'ve learnt that egate is brighter than the rest two...Thirdly, the images are sharp and there\\'s no blur on text on egate compared to the other two... Just learn to adjust the keystone properly...Fourth, the length of the power cord is longer in egate...Fifth, it\\'s got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use... The others don\\'t have it...Now in general I\\'ve not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users, so I\\'m gonna tell u wat I\\'ve done n wat else u can do with egate...I\\'ve placed it at a length of 15 feet from the screen n it gives awesome display... Connect a 2.1 /5.1 home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at 2/3 feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping around...I\\'ve connected my SECOND FIRE TV Stick, with it so it connects to Wi-Fi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n FF... Also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etc...U get a remote which functions well along with it...MOST IMPORTANTLY, U CAN CEILING MOUNT IT OR TRIPOD IT TOO WHICH THE OTHER TWO CANT... BUT remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by 180° in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod it\\'s not necessary...Also u can place the projector behind the screen LIKE AN ACTUAL THEATRE IF U R USING A CLOTH SCREEN LIKE ME N CONSTRAINT OF SPACE, BUT REMEMBER TO FLIP THE IMAGE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IN SETTINGS AS THE PROJECTOR IS BEHIND THE SCREEN N U NEED TO GET A 90° FLIPPED IMAGE FROM BEHIND...so I guess it\\'s the 3d part that made ur decision murky, wat I would love to say for that is I\\'ve a Samsung 3d enabled smart tv n I\\'ve seen the output of these kind of cheap 3d devices too, since its a low cost projector 3d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a TV if 3d is a priority, as in TV the 3d effects r awesome... But nowadays u can install an APP IN ANY DEVICE to watch 3d movies or better download a 3d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur 3d glasses... My friends do it but I DON\\'T...VERDICT : \"BEST PROJECTOR IN MARKET IN MY OPINION FOR THE PRICE AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSE\"NOTE : FOR AMAZON PRIME N NETFLIX USERS, IF U R USING A 2.1 AUDIO OUTPUT SOMETIMES U MIGHT NOT GET AUDIO SO DONT GET WORRIED N ITS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROJECTOR ITS JUST THAT THE LATEST MOVIES ARE MADE WITH DOLBY 5.1 SOUND SO JUST USE THE ON SCREEN SETTING IN THE VIDEO TO NAVIGATE TO SOUND N CHOOSE STEREO FROM THE DEFAULT DOLBY OPTION & VOILA U R DONE...!!!HOPE IT HELPS, PING ME FOR ANY DOUBTS...HIT LIKE, IF MY REVIEW WAS USEFUL...!!!,As per money it\\'s bestBut if you are fan of pictures qualityThink about budget good,Value for money 👍,This is really a good quality cable , it’s too long enough for modern tv units size , works excellent with Sony Bravia tv,Perfect size and extremely good quality hdmi 2.1 cable that gives eARC connecting option.,,Purchased this hdmi to connect the setup box with my new Samsung tv 4k@120 hz native, unfortunately when used this wire to connect the picture quality was bad and was seeing red dots all over the picture. When replaced with another HDMI cable all the issues were fixed. So in short this procut was bad.,Value for money good picture quality Remote control is functional well.,All functions are working. Remote is not making any qwerking plastic sounds. Not so solid as original remote. Overall satisfied,There is no mic option and few buttons were messed up,Its better then original even its light weight with softr buttons.,It\\'s oky product, in this price range, it don\\'t have voice serch option,Good,Not bad,Good The build quality is good. Not sure on the reliability front , let’s see in few months. The sound quality is satisfactory. There is a reduction in sound which is expected during conversion anyway.  But considering the price it’s negligible. Overall a good buy. Will recommend this one especially for TV’s without optical out and just coax/spdif out.,How relace it with warranty,For converting digital audio of Sony Bravia xr55x90j  4k UHd to Sony DAV-DZ150Kanalogue with R/L sound ouputFirst device did not work may be my errorReplacement device is excellentit is giving me virtual 5.1 effect while watching movies on Disney hot star and Amezon primemy 15cyears old DAV- DZ-150K home theaterwithout any digital output is giving perfe ct virtual 5.1 effect on PCM AudioReplacement device was delivered by Amezon injust two days timeExcellent service by AmezonThanks also to U tube from where I learned my lessons of installing this classic deviceI was very disappointed on 1st device and as there is no return policy I asked for replacement and it worked very welland now I am very happy and would like to recommend to people who have new TV without any Analog output and has only digital and HDMI output and old home theater systems with only Analog,component, or composit outputThank you Amezon for this Diwali gift,Doesn\\'t Provides Surround Sound,Very nice product. I am using it last few months. Sound quality is very good,Good,Soooo nice,Good I purchased the cable for my Galaxy Note 9 in July 2022. Have been using it since and it works neat. The cable is tough due to its braided nature.,Overall good for usage, not faced any quality issues. C point section is also good to fit properly in mobile. You can go for it.,Most expensive cable I have ever purchased. Probably the best cable too. Giving 1 star less for the premium pricing.I bought this as the long cables dont work well with Android Car. This works very well. Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ₹309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won\\'t come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars, I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn\\'t charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use, the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ₹300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality, the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle, I am sure I will put it through some abuse and I can comment on the same when I revisit this review for updates.Durability:I will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective, as my first Wayona dash charge cable I used for Oneplus 6 died in 3 months. But thankfully it was replaced under warranty. That shows how good the support is from Wayona team. I only had to record that the cable died and doesn\\'t charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product.Verdict:If you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on  or for charging devices from powerbanks, I would definitely recommend this cable.,Data transfer is quite fast, and also, compatible with my QC adapter.,Good,Excellent... Worth for the money,Nice wire, fast charge. Liked the product.  Accurate to my usb apparatus.,Good value,Till now i had purchased about 20 cables both micro and c type for myself and my family in this last one year. Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price,na,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that, i am sure it is not very durable. the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex. the wire will break before the connector does!!warning: usb micro connector has a strong hook. be careful while plugging and unplugging, or you may damage your device.very cheap and usable cable for 120 rs,Super power,Nice product.,In this price this is the best one Good one….,Very good sturdy,I am using this in the car and work fine for far, writing this review after 2 weeks.,This cable charge as well transfer data without even any mfi certified,Very Happy with this one,my cable stopped working in a week.,Worth🌱,This material was good The cable is good slightly thicker than the Apple original cables and is only good for charging.It doesn\\'t work for data transmission contrary to what some one has mentioned in the replies to one of the queries.  Not at least with apple products. It charges my iPad Pro with M2 Chip but freezes it, if used for data transmission.Any one looking for data transmission better find something else.This item is only good for Charging.,,Works fine. No issues so far.,As per Belkin product page, there is NO mention that it supports 60W. Belkin support in Q/A section says it supports only 15W. Needs to be investigated if it really is fast charging or not. Scummy behaviour from Belkin to not specify such a basic spec.belkin.com/us/cables/charging/boost-charge-usb-c-to-usb-c-cable/p/p-cab003/,All belkin products are of excellent  quality and build , Thanks to belkin for providing  a good products and thanks to seller and Amazon for selling this product.,Excellent product,I guess it\\'s only Belkin compared to the rest of the third-party companies, which make quality cables. You can feel the quality in your hands. Worth it, although you may find it to be expensive.,as expected Compatabile for samsung tvs can buy and use them with out any fear.,It works perfectly like original remote. Maybe the price can be reduced a bit.,Only have 1 week experience, it\\'s working smoothly till now,It works aa expected.... Light weight after putting battery also... Weighs lesser than original Samsung remote.... I\\'m not sure about durability... But good product and does help for my TV... Since original remote broke,The product and its features are really good and self explaining. Also,  the built quality is good.,The remote is working fine for now but durability not sure as not as the original but does the job.,It is good for Samsung smart tv,nice one I like the product and I used it for my iphone,The product got delivered fast. It surely does work for the price you pay for it. Does a good work of charging the iPhones without any lags. I will recommend. In fact bought a couple of other products too after taking this cable.,Its build quality is excellent and it charges the phone quickly despite being a long cable which is a good feature of it.,Nice product for rough use. I have been using this in my car since day one & it has taken all the weathering. Good product, zero hassles, zero complaint. Go for it!,Nice product☑️,Good and convenient product for those who don’t want long dangling wires from their power banks😊,I bought a Wayona One Plus cable and then this cable a few years later, never faced an issue. Recommended it to my friends as well, no one faced an issue with Wayona products thus far. Worth it.,Quality product  , Life of product is good  . really good producers,Good with working conditions only voice assistant not working,I am using Kodak 80 cm (32 inches) HD Ready Certified Android LED TV 32HDX7XPRO.If you have the same model tv then just go for it.,Best product,Not feather touch,I like it having good performance,Everything is fine except voice control. However w.r.t. price of voice controlled remotes, it\\'s much better.,Reasonable priced Tv working good, the screen is VA type, if we want to see good picture we need to maintain minimum distance to tv because this tv pixels are so big. But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV\\'s colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it\\'s sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.,Writing  review after 1.5 month use overall good but it become little slow when we install apps rest everything is fine. I liked it and i think you also love it if your budget is in this range.,First fall I was take as buy a acer tv, then I have fear because acer tv is new brand and if any problem with tv serving. But after purchased and  using my fear was goes. Because tv functions is good. And warranty also available.,Overall its a  good product, some times it lags and once it got auto restarted.but company has lied to customers with that there is 16 gb of space in the TV which is not therestill i like the picture and sound quality,I am very happy when I order this tv. I have purchased it on Diwali. When we start to use this tv, we found that to use the cromecast feature I need to install a third party app which is not support to my mobile phone (samsung M21). I am very disappointed now  for this feature but what can i do now. It has good and loud sound system. My overall experience is not meet to my expectations.,I regret not having gotten a larger size. This is an amazing smart tv, clear view and awesome sound. 4 stars only because I couldnt get jio universal remote to work with it.,Under 15k best smart Android TV everything is perfect  like sound, picture quality, Bluetooth connectivity and wifi. Connectivity,Finally a budget friendly smart TV  for middle class people who is having 30k salary per month. Picture quality- Ok Ok,  Sound- super, warnty- best, remote - simple over all nice one. No product is perfect in all segments, this one also not an exception. Quality is good, strong build, supports fast charging rates. Some people may find the LED really bright especially in the dark and it cannot be turned off. The port itself can be a bit loose but it can be used with cases are a bit thick.Just check if your smartphone has earphone jack beside the charging port in which case you might not be able to use both together.,Happy with the product,Good,Good one,More time teken,Nice worth it,Good quality,Good product thanks Amazon Good device and makes your laptop to utilize maximum wifi speed. Will definitely recommend this one.,Good Product, worth of buying,After installing new fiber at my place i got to know that my wifi reciever in my PC was not capable of reciving 5g speed. So i have ordered this from amazon. This is an amazing product which is working totally fine till now.Only problem is they do not instruct that you have to plug this in usb 3.0 port to receive 5g speed. It will recieve only 4g on usb 2.0..  over all best product and nice range,Good,I am using this product for the last couple of months now. It was really easy to install and easy to use. My laptop is an old one and is not compatible with 5Ghz bandwidth, hence I had to look for a Wifi adapter and I stumbled upon this and I don\\'t regret buying it. It is working as per my expectation and I am able to utilize the 5Ghz network on my laptop now. A must-buy for anyone having an issue with 5Ghz bandwidth. It\\'s a lifesaver.,I used to have wifi6 on my laptop, now I’m using this dongle with wifi5 and frankly, I did not notice a difference.,I just connect with my iPhone hotspot to pc nd it’s so nice very fast,Hello guys I bought this product from Amazon and it was a very fast delivery as It was easy installation  less than two Minutes  it gives the best signal of 5G and 4G so it won’t be hassle to install it’s the product for guys who don’t have Wi-Fi adapters in the systems. Also it it very Compact Product About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the \\'so called free\\' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it\\'s pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It\\'s awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can\\'t use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it\\'s a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It\\'s running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it\\'s good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn\\'t happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(₹11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money Everything is fine but it is bulky and hard, it should be softer and thinner.....,Thank you  Amazon very good charging cable 👍,Good,Good one,quality is good. worth for 150-200 ₹. short but durable.,Very Good product . Satisfied..,This is fast charging C pin USB!You can purchase it.,Nice product at price of below 100 Cable is long and durable. Its worth the purchase.,I recommend this product whoever needs a sturdy and fast charging also keep in mind your charger needs to support while using this cable,After seeing the reviews I ordered for this product for my Samsung S9 mobile. Although the cable is very steady and good it fails the main purpose. When I keep my mobile for charging the cable pin is very tight and I fear while putting and removing my mobile charging chip would break as it is very tight. I am looking for another alternative.So if you are looking for a charger for S9 Samsung mobile PLEASE FO NOT BUY IT.,Good,Superb,I have oneplus 6 mobile phone and have dash charger and oneplus cable which becomes a fast charging combo.However when i plugged in this cable with dash charger. It was not rapidly charging my phone. So I can\\'t say if this is fast charging cable ot not.But as a common charging cable this is working perfectly fine,This is one of the best cable for fast charging. I have 3 units of 2 meter c type cable. I don\\'t think it will get damage soon. The quality is very good and charging S22 ultra, Galaxy note 8 etc without any problem. Thanks to China,Standard Product. Worth the money..... Product is good in quality. Working good with my i phone 7.,Good quality and really fast charging and packing is also like original one worth product,Good product and good quality,Working well with iphone11., Good,Its working is very nice with pc.

But we can\\'t use continues ly.... Signal breaks suddenly,I have been  using this WiFi module for more than a couple of months and it works like a charm. It \\'s easy to use and it connects quick to the computer and don\\'t need to install the drivers.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,good to work,Working fine till date,Good Product Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It\\'s great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item. The product was nice its charging awesome,Cant say anything about durability and sturdiness as the part which gets connected to adapter seems to be in a highly vulnerable state. With a flick of hand it might get bent as my last charging chord got to be so i had to buy this one. Something must be done about that.,Very good worth the money,I had to replace the cable that I had recieved with my laptop. I opted Zoul and am highly satisfied by the cable. It\\'s durable and works seamlessly.,This is an amazing product from Zoul. I bought many other cables before from other brands but they didn\\'t work that well. But this, I must say is the Best of all in terms of charging power, durability and sturdiness. Much Recommend!!,I\\'ve been using this cable for over 6 months with my Galaxy S22 it\\'s been working flawlessly. Fast charging works as expected and the 2m length makes it convenient to use it in bed. Would recommend to anyone looking for a long cable. Infact, my brother purchased one after seeing me buy it.,The cable has good length, charges very fast, Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it.

Thank you so much remote is compatible no about durability.currently it\\'s working,Nice one.working good, voice is not working properly,The volume control buttom is way to hard to operate must be a little smoother....,Not strong,I was doubtful about the purchase looking at all the reviews but the product is great. Firstly you need to understand how to pair the remote properly, search for youtube videos and they will help you a lot.There are reviews specifying the remote did not connect, please note \\'YOU NEED TO UNPAIR YOUR BROKEN BLUETOOTH REMOTE FIRST!\\'I used MI remote app to unpair the remote and then paired the new remote.,I purchased this remote in October 20th but it was not working properly in December with in 2months the product was failed so i recommend do not but this product don\\'t waste your money,Works well with my mi tv. As soon as I switched the tv on, it recognised the remote and paired. No complaints. Too early to comment on the battery life.PS: first time turn on the tv using the power button on the tv.,Draining the batteries in one hour.. And not functioning Works fine with my Sony Bravia TV.,,,Quality of control would have been better,apart from that no issue,Working well, buil quality is okay,It\\'s just like original. It\\'s working very well good quality and Amazon never disappoint me.thank you,Not for good,It looks like original but the build quality is not so good But value for money Thank you Amazon,The length is too small,Ok so before I bought it, with my old cable, I thought that the speed was standard with an HDD about 6 years old. But once I got it, man, is it fast. Highly recommend it if your HDD has slowed down, it\\'s probably the cable that came stock with your HDD, that\\'s slowing it down.,Yes good,Cable length  is very small like 6 cm but transfer speed is good 70 to 90 mb/s..,Good,It\\'s working fine even after months,Amazing product meet all your expectations Works smooth,The lenght of the cord is preety long. The charging power is not hampered due to its lenght. Well braided wire. Worth to go for. If you want short wire dont go for this. Else this is a good choice for all.,Good,You can definitely get this product I am using it very roughly but there is no problem at all works fine,Lovely product in affordable price..,It has a rope-ish wire which is very long and I needed it for the car when I am charging while travelling. Decent speed for charging also. It’s not super fast like your regular iPhone charger but it does the job well. Compatible with portable charger also,Nice cable , length is very well good ,But charging speed is little bit slow otherwise good. Go for it😌,Writing after 2 years, it works amazing Good budget mfi certified lightly cable for this price . Update usage review after 3 to 5 months .,Better than the original one in matter of robustness and durability. Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified, Good product 👍🏻,Nice products and easy to use.very good quality and the product is very good 😊,,Simply Go for it.I have been using this almost for the last 1.5 years. I have been using this every day, the whole day during office hours, and sometimes work at home both for my Phone and Laptop using with 65-watt charger.It is trouble-free and does its job as we expect it to do. No problem whatsoever.The big plus point with this cable is that it does not entangle to develop constant fold that becomes cracks over a period of time. This is the issue that I had with other cables. This one is perfect.As I said, You can simply go for it. Strongly recommended.,Best,The length could have been longer,Value for money,Godd quality material and fast charging Price is high in respect of product quality,Durable and strudy,It is sturdy and works fine.,Best,This is an excellent product from Amazonbasics.,High quality cable 3 times better than original cables supplied with HDDs.

All in all, a hassle-free warranty claim.Shall share an update once I get the replacement.,Very sturdy cable, best fit for rough n tough use.,Very nice cable,Very good product When I say Android TV few buyers wouldn\\'t be able to grasp it . It has unofficial build of Android 9 so basically you can install all Android TV apk and apps . For play store you can install aptoide manually and it can install all bunch of TV apps for your afterwards.Since it\\'s unofficial build , you can\\'t have Google app services and Play Store , it won\\'t work at all .Overall happy with thisPicture Quality GreatApps does not lagDoes not hangsNot having heating issueOnly problem is apps and functions aren\\'t organised, you needed to go through all the stuffsThere is a similar TV with official Android 11 , it\\'s better to take that if you need official Build as well as Google Play Store and Services.Overall Happy in budget !!,Wall mount was not found inside the TV pack,Better,Product is good. Picture quality is ok. I bought this product @ 6999 and also get 10% discount, final amount is 6300 at this price product is best.But installation service is not good.Wall mount is inside the box. Installation service man say rs.300 for wall mount and otherwise no installation.,Nice product 😌👍,very happy,Picture quality,Value for money product Using with my Xbox and it\\'s working perfectly,A good upgrade from stock cable which i got from samsung. The sound quality has definitely improved in the soundbar. It is loud enough between 10-15 volume. However the subwoofer output has not improved significantly.,I GOT NORMAL INSTEAD OF PREMIUM CABLE WITH SMALL SIZE. BUT LUCKILY I GET USE TO IT.,Works really well.,Absolutely top class for the money spent. No loss of signal, as good as if there is no splitter involved. Fantastic buy as most TVs have only one optical output.,,Getting proper 5.1 channel surround sound.Channel seperation is great.I\\'m using it in jio setbox with zebronics zuke 9400 pro 5.1 sound bar,Worked as expected with my LG tv I got this for 6k. At this price point, I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn\\'t expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn\\'t have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall, I\\'d say, for a small room, it\\'s a 7/10.,Value for money, Satisfied with the product till now,This Led tv low budget Good 👍 Performance but picture & audio not good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/61QvXYP2McL._SY88.jpg,Good,Tv is great but the installation guy asked me for 400₹ paid installation... Misleading information but again for this price it\\'s good tv. Don\\'t pay installation guy you can do it yourself,,I will give it 4 stars out of 5. I bought this 32 inch VW at 6150 after discounts. Picture quality and sound quality is good.I added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv. The connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvs.So far, working as it should.Revising this after 9 days, the tv is not responding to switch off button. This is happening more when i watch the tv for a few hours and then when i switch off the tv with the firestick remote, the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red, instead it remains yellow. As far as screen is concerned, the tv\\'s screen changes to black whitish, seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode. This is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red. i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees, then i should get a replacement as i got still 2 days time to replace it.Just a helping note for people buying this tv: if you are going to connect firestick to it, as it asks for the brand name of the tv, you can select VU and it will perfectly work on your firestick. Thanks and enjoy! Does not always accurately read on PC,Working fine for last 3 years,I purchased this cable to connect apple car play.Its working.,Charges fast. Better than iphone original cable as it wont bend or cut down at the joints. Bought in lightning deal for ₹699,Good one, fast charger,Highly recommended,Good quite,Long lasting Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\\'t perfectly black - and they\\'re brighter than you\\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\\'t produce the contrast you\\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\\'t even use your phone\\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\\'d say I\\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\\'t change my decision. It\\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec\\'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don\\'t have voice recognition. I don\\'t require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It\\'s clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money.

Depending on customers reviews and duracell brand I purchased this cable. But regret to say that charging speed is very very low.. I charged my tablet and within one and a half hour only 10 percent charged.  Not at all satisfied with the product.,The quality of wire and usb pin is good but it charge mobile little slow than the charger provided with mobile by oppo / real me / samsung.,Was working well but suddenly stopped working within 6 months of purchase.,Best product After 1-2 months , it has become worse and my phone dosent charge or takes too much time like 11 to 12 hours. Sometimes it doesnt even connect to the phone.Dont buy it, dont buy any other cheap cables.

Pros- xiomi 5a is best in budget-Nice picture quality-Very nice audio output- Full of featureCONS- sometimes tv lags-Sometimes stucksIn this prize range all tv having cons like this.::Overall nice tv,The product in this price range is good but as it is running in Android 12 it lags. I hope after few updates the lags problem will be resolved,Useless product and useless quality. Display issues within 7 months and service center is not upto the mark. Go for better brands where quality is assured. I would wish if there was option of negative stars.,Uses as connectes TV the picture is very good. I was hopping a best level of song.

I am really happy to get good material. Hope saitechit team will maintain quality in their products.Thanks to Amazon for shipping it faster.,working good,product was overall good,Theek hi h Sometimes its simple solutions that come to rescue than a costly alternate from branded companies.  I had my Sony TV in perfect working condition but remote got worn out (kids handled it smoothly LOL).  When i tried to purchase original remote from Sony, i was either not able to find an exact one or the remote itself is costly.  At that point i thought to take risk with this piece of marvel and it worked like a charm.  Smooth operation and no setup needed.  I highly recommend this product.

Was expecting the item but when the delivery got late i had to understand unfortunately the product is of no good to me. This item was glued at the edges,,Good but fits loose at top, bit tight at bottom. But still, Can go with the purchase.,This fits the Samsung Smart TV Remote perfectly, All edges are covered too, so if you do drop you remote from a decent height, it will not let the remote get scratched or cracked but you can\\'t expect it to save you from all kinds of drops.I believe I needed it because my kid keeps dropping the remote and I was worried because the Samsung Smart Remote is quite expensive. It even fits the slightly tilted shape of the remote quite perfectly.,Product is good as described and fitted perfectly very smoothly. Thanks amazon,A good product in a higher price side,Average ok ok quality,Fit can be better as side portions are loose and might reduce overall cover\\'s life as kids put finger and small items into it.

This products is working. I used it an old iPod touch. I am able to charge and transfer data. I hope the product has good shelf-life as well. Value for money,After a bad experience with FastX charging cable for iPad, I was apprehensive to buy any such thing online. But, then I decided to try once more with Amkette.To my delight, the cable fitted the port and started charging the iPad.

Within 2 MONTHS...BUT.... When I contacted them on the given WhatsApp number, they right away sent me a new cable the very next day....5 stars for keeping the promise and professionalism....------------------First purchase review:Writing after 6 months of usage...Everything happened as expected and written below after purchase... After 5-6 months, Cable stopped PC connectivity.... Then after a month it started showing problems in charging... It used to charge in one position only, and charging used to stop with little movement...Finally had to replace it with new one after 6-7 months....Since the price is now reduced to 300, so I will say good product in this price... Not long lasting... If you want a reliable, long lasting, long length cable , go for original from oneplus showroom....--------------------------(Initial review written just after purchase)Yes, it supports dash charge, and no heating issues... (Using it since 3 days).One NEGATIVE point is short length... It is 1 meter long ... Original cable is 1.5 meters... So it is difficult to use my phone while charging.....Other NEGATIVE point I can figure out is that cable is really hard... In my experience hard cables break more often than soft pliable ones... It is not easy to put a hard cable in my bag without putting strain on it (for daily commute to office)... this makes them to break easily before time.....Hard cables are also not easy to use when the mobile is charging... It puts strain on both the points, the charger side and mobile side, which again makes it vulnerable to cracks...This raises a question on longevity of the cable.....Let\\'s do some calculations.....My original OnePlus cable lasted for 2 years, cost of which at present is Rs.1100.... it was soft, easy to bend and keep in my bag while traveling daily for work.... The Rs.1100 cable online is 1.5 meters long, which makes it easy to work on phone while it is plugged.....Popio cable costs Rs.400 at present (but they show it 999 , which means price may rise) ... So, even if it lasts for 6-8 months, it will be more costly to me than an original cable in 2 years... Popio cable is 1 meter long, against 1.5 meters of original cable... So effective price of popio cable is Rs.500 for 1.5 meter cable...Popio cable is 1 meters long against 1.5 meters of original cable... Which makes it not easy to use the phone while it is charging.... Using a short cable while charging puts strain on the cable and phone\\'s charging port, which is damaging for both, and also decreases life of both the cable and charging port.....They say you have to consider cost while writing review... But you should also consider cost on long run, not just the immediate cost.... ..So, if u are thinking of changing your phone in coming future and don\\'t want to spend too much on cable, Popio is the best option available....But, if you are looking for a long term solution, and you can afford to buy Rs.1100 cable, I will suggest to go for the original one.... It has more length, it is soft, and it lasts longer with moderate use...,I ordered this cable for 330/- in the sale yesterday. When i plugged in the cable it wasn\\'t charging Rapidly on my OnePlus. But then immediately i booked for a replacement cable which arrived this morning and i plugged it in and voila! \"Charging Rapidly \" Thankful,2nd purchase review....Purchased on 17 July 2019, dash charge STOPPED WORKING on 15 September 2019...

The charging speed is good and the transfer rate is somewhat less compared to original OnePlus Cable,Good quality, long lasting Good product,The wire worked fine for 1.5 months then started problems. for a few days, I could not understand why my phone did not charge whole the night and then i realized, the cables automatically stops working and starts on their own wish, when checked came to know the product had only one month\\'s warranty,This is so good. Charging quality is amazing. Durability is also good. Worth buying,Good product,I am extremely happy with the charger. It is working fine.,It’s not a fast charger, infact the charging works only one side. Doesn’t work as a data cable as wel. Wouldn’t recommend if someone is looking for data + charging. One time usage product.,Liked the product alot. Value for money,Good Product The remote is exact like the original one. But its not a Universal remote. However, for a given price its value for money, works well.,Tata Sky remote for Rs. 140 (incl. taxes & free delivery) is worth money spent. It is not original but working fine. What more you expect at this lowest cost and promptest delivery.,Qulaity is not very good but ok as per price,Looks different from my original remote but working fine as of now,Order placed for 2 remote controls and received only 1,Good product but please ship with batteries.,Not as expected,It\\'s good Good projector for this price range...nice picture quality.. stylish design and finishing also good but low audio volume.it\\'s better to use extra speakers...,Good quality for the price,It was amazing to see it in big picture at home.. and the pixel projector was rocking... but one thing we can enjoy the big picture well in minimal or no light....,The projector is soo good for a small home theatre!! The video output is damn good from a small device!!! Connected it with my Amazon fire stick!! I’m really satisfied with the purchase! ❤️,I will put a detailed review after a month. However at first glance, this product is worth for 6500 rupees you pay.,,I give 5 out of 5 star because resolution is 720p., Value for money,The remote is compatible with our Tata sky box and does the job,It didn\\'t last for more than 15 days and has stopped working. Absolutely waste of money. Please don\\'t go for this product,Ok types for the value,Waste product,  don\\'t sale other waste of money,It is good, works well with my Tatasky. Re durable, will come to know later. So far good,I\\'ve ordered this remote without knowing that it is not returnable.It do not work with the TV and not even with the Set Top Box. It asks for another remote (original) in order to catch signal and configure, in what world I would buy this nonsense if I do have the original remotes working.Instead Ordered the remote with Tata Sky which will work with Set Top box and TV,It works Sufficient length,excellent build quality ,good alternative to generic cables,Strong cable, the cable ends are nearly like rubber. GOLD coated. Cable is also of high thickness.,Why I bought this ?I have DVR rack, for DVR which is far above the reach limit hence I need a mouse to be connected to the USB port of the DVR which is in the rack above reachAny alternatives?Wireless mouse didn\\'t work well with my particular DVR, had lots of lag,  hence I had to resort to a USB port extender with ample lengthResult :Very sturdy cable able to connect to my DVR and connection is stable .Amazon basics is very reliable.,This cable is good for any device that needs extension over USB 2.0 like printers, TVs, gaming consoles, keyboards etc.The build quality is good. Cable material is soft so it will not break. Connectors are gold plated and will not rust.But remember, this cable will not give USB 3.0 speeds even if you connect it to a USB 3.0 port.,For Usb 2.0 , any usb 3.0 if used will behave as usb 2.0Type: ADirection: female to maleFunction: extension of length of usbBuilt: average  not cloth/fibre braiderLength: as mentionedWorks for all connections: yes [including pc\\\\printer\\\\console pen drive etc ],Product is as per description,Good as expected. I was looking for durable cable for my ipad cause the cable apple provides in the box feels pretty flimsy, and doesn\\'t really inspire confidence. Also, i use my Ipad primarily for gaming, so it is almost always connected to my pc while gaming.So, i needed a really sturdy cable, that could charge, sync and and feel good while doing it.And this cable does the job perfectly!!It is sturdy. My ipad has taken a few drops my table and was saved my this cable. Even after 3 months of daily abuse, this cable has no signs of wear and tear.The charge speed is the same as the original apple cable. And so is the sync speed.One thing this cable does better than the original cable is the connection quality. It hardly ever accidentally breaks the connection while moving around too much, which was a problem with my original cable.I\\'m very satisfied with the purchase and i even have a spare one in case of an emergency.,Quality cable material. It feels durable. Charges my iPhone just fine. Thanks Amazon.,,,The product is good, build quality is good and does what\\'s said in the description of the product. But it stopped working within 6 months of usage. The prod was ordered in Apr 22 and now in Sept 22 its  not charging the phone at all.I have contacted Amazon for the same and looking forward for their help.,Used it as a back up to charge phone in car. Apple car play has stopped working intermittently when using this cable,Good product but phn was getting heat while its chrgeing,This cable is working great. It’s durable and charging power is also good.Recommended👍 The remote works well and is pleasantly compatible with the system.,It\\'s a good Remote. All the functions are working for tatasky,Nice quality,The back cover was loose and fragile.,👌,Good,मैंने tata play का remote मंगवाया था. पर वो काम नहीं कर रहा था. फिर रिटर्न के लिए apply किया. आज 19 दिन हो गए ना ही remote मिला और ना ही refund.,Very prompt replacement of the defective Remote for TV Nice product,Nice product,Ok good,,Good,अच्छा,Only for home drama and cinema experienceGood to buy in this price rangeReview after two months its working fine without any issues, Update after 9 months of use:1. The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It\\'s as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates, the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube, Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that\\'s an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However, after using it for 2 months, the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now, up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes, I set brightness to 0, and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,a. it often gets disconnected from wifi - have to restart it againb. prime video fails to resume - displays error - and have to restart the TV againc. On the home screen, you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first. You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first - easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself.,Only Cons till now got, fast moving object looks blurr, which was known before buying by other user review, but i got this tv in 32 k,Ao over all satishfied,Only minus that too critical is the installation service provider.The product is to installed by v care installation services provider.The installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properly.Actual date of installation was on 21.02.22 but was only done by the service provider on 27.10.22.The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and don\\'t know how to behave to the customer.He behaved very rudely.The installation service provider is a total damage and waste. Not at all worth.,,Awesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tv.,Dolby atom 4 k video etc,Good,Good I\\'m using this from 6 months back, it\\'s working for me till now.,Must buy.

The cable is lengthy no quality loss till yet.ps:- i will update if there is any issues,,Looks like cheap, but works fine Working as expected,Good product, Perfectly works with Amazon Firestick,Works,Works well, no lagging and disconnecting issue. Good quality.,Very Good Connector,I bought it for my projector as my HDMI cable was short to reach the port. I joint 2 HDMI cable with the help of this coupler. I warked like a chram and saved me money to buy a long cable.,Product is good but not working with Fire tv stick.,Good fit This is bed product low quality material use,I bought it during travel works perfect,This is my second cable and it is good and alternative to Apple ones but need to check the durability down the lane,Extremely happy with Quality and Sturdy,Good one! No more changing of cables every year or soo.,As I need for apple carplay support this is perfect with no lag. Anyone who has usb type A port in car needs this one to run apple CarPlay seemlessly.,Extremely durable and efficient for car,Charging is very slow it takes more than 3 hours for full charge, also the battery capacity is getting decreased from 93% to 90% & that\\'s bad 😑 used it for a week but it was performing the same Looks durable Charging is fine tooNo complains,Charging is really fast, good product.,Till now satisfied with the quality.,This is a good product . The charging speed is slower than the original iPhone cable,Good quality, would recommend,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81---F1ZgHL._SY88.jpg,Product had worked well till date and was having no issue.Cable is also sturdy enough...Have asked for replacement and company is doing the same...,Value for money Durable but little slow,Buy at 300+ rsLocal market we can get it 150-200/-Functionality and durability ok, but price point is bit high..,Poor quality.battery drains fast,TV on off button defective,The remote is working fine. I want to reset the Airtel remote. How do I do it?,Working,Review after i raise Complaint to Customer care: They really took it on priority and resent the new product. Its really working fine as of now.Waste of buying it. Most of the keys stopped working within a month. And not even 2 months whole remote is not working.,Awesome product works very well I\\'m using it for Dell 22-inch monitor and I found it difficult to fit, hence I had to visit the fabrication shop to smoothen the corners else it is really good,,Good,Quality of the product is good. But it didn\\'t clearly suit the Samsung monitor I have. I had to remove a specific part behind the monitor and adjusted this wall mount. Till now no issue.,Product is good. I am using Benq ex2780q monitor. Holds well enough but there are only 2 places to screw it in. This makes you doubt sometimes weather this can hold up the weight of the monitor. I have been using it for the past 2 months and haven\\'t faced any issue.Another problem with this montioe is the rubber that is used for rotating the montioe is cheap and gets broken initially only. But replaced with proper nuts and this worked fine for meFinal verdict: good monitor wall mount easily taking 5kg of weight on it.Could have been better if the rubber material and count of screw holes in the wall mount be more,Great product at reasonable rate. Very easy to install. Very sturdy product. Never feel like monitor will fall down.👍🏻,Self install a bit difficult. The plate connecting to monitor could have been removable and drop in clamp . This would make fixing a breeze,It\\'s doing the job well. My 27\" monitor is holding it firmly on the wall. Good,Using it for Samsung Z Fold 4 with an Ambrane 30W charger.Fast charging works. Side on design is very practical.Sturdy build. Well worth the money.,Very useful,Very nice in this price range,The cable quality is great and its built well, both sides are L shaped connectors ( 1 side of the cable should have been regular as L shaper port blocks other ports and if you have a mobile stand you can\\'t use this cable.Its very bad for data transfer even a 1 gb file takes 5 or more minutes.Great for charging, supports fast charging as well. If you want a cable just for charging your phone its great.Updating review after getting a replacement, now it doesn\\'t even fast charge my phone. Returned it.,Product is good.But sometimes there are little bit charging problem seen.It shows disconnected from charging while it is plugged in.BTW, some weeks later it eaten by our goat😂Then I bought one new.,Best quality cable at best price,Short review: Go for it if you are looking for a C2C charging cable at 60W or less. Sturdy and stylish with an added advantage of 90° connectors.[Deal price: ₹139]Long review:I have been using Portronics products lately and I have to appreciate the quality and innovation they bring to the end users.Products I own from Portronics: • My Buddy k3 • Brillo 3 • Power Plate 7 • Mobot one • Clamp M • Konnect LAll the products I bought from Portronics not just met my expectations but they performed beyond that. It made me start building trust on the brand.I use S21 ultra which can be charged at 25W and this cable supports the same with the Samsung\\'s original charger. I strongly believe the product would work at the rated power delivery (60W).It looks and feels sturdy and I am expecting it to be durable too.The 90° ends keep the cables away without out interfering with the work space. Works the best when playing battle royale games as the cable won\\'t come in the way.The grey and black colour combination works as a charm and would blend in with Apple devices.Data transfer speeds are yet to be tested. I will update here once I have enough inputs on the same.After using multiple cables from Ambrane, Wayona, Wecool, and more brands Portronics definitely stands as a good contender for all of them that serve the same purpose.Verdict: I would definitely recommend this Type-c to Type-c cable if you need to charge devices at 60W or less. https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61T7yiKCRXL._SY88.jpg,Good,good one installation very fast sound good quality good service better ever and everything is good and totally satisfied product,Good,HD and non hd separateEverything is absolutely to the expectations,Ok,I was using Tata sky from around 10years.When i got installed it was around 2500rs that is really looting middle class people and also for recharge i use to pay 350rs and really it was very horrible situation in the past. Village people are really looted a lot from these installation people, so called Engineers.One day I was checking Google and found this set-up box with 1000rs and shocked and felt it was some joke.Then after approaching Amazon i got to realise it is true.And i ordered one box for my 55inch LG UHD TV as they expected so called Engineers  never came on time.And i had a call with customer support to get it cancelled. Then they responded and came to deliver and installing.These engineers are really talented and started adding prices for every thing that i have already paid. ex. Remote, Wire, Antenna.They started charging for every little thing. There i got to realise, how these people looting uneducated or unaware people.So please be aware when ever you are purchasing any product check and ask questions for everything.Product Review:  Product is upto my mark. Quality of the video and HD channels with a less price is really amazing. Tata sky is the mark of materials and picture quality software is really great and easy to use.,Thank you Cheap price.... Looks good..... Value for money....,Product is not strong , assembled pets are loose and not fixed firmly . Works fine with Samsung . Have to wait and see it’s durability,You can buy it, nice,Can buy,very good suitable for my samsung tv,Plastic quality not good,True to its name, it works absolutely fine with the Samsung led.Just the Netflix and prime buttons aren\\'t there bt great to use otherwise,Plastic quality is not good Superb… am writing this after 2 months usage… simply super product… should go blindly… never dissatisfied..,Ok,Can buy in in this price range,Delivery was fast but the product quality is just fine not very promising.Issue: The battery got struck into the remote, though it is working fine for my Sony D100 but I may have to either break the remote to take out the battery, rest I think everything is fine at the price.,Excellent.working super,First remote I received was not working, but seller replaced it and that is working fine.,Price is good.Quality is also super,Thank you so much for selling this product with best price. Like ok,Product as specified,Good,,Yes it\\'s very good product,I tried many wires, but only this worked on my sansui 65inch. 2years warranty from the seller is the best part,Sometimes not working properly,The product works nice, no lags in video/audio, definitely worth every paisa spent on it.I cant comment on its durability after a week of use. I need more time. Product is not working after 2 months,Boat💕,Nice product,Worth a buy,Really satisfying quality and product is still working fine.,Worth itSame as original,Not worthy,Thik aaw Like : quick data transfer, Dislike: geting hot itself in 2 minutes and let other pendrives getting hot also.,Product, Built quality, Transfer speed all good. Small in size so easy  hold and carry anywhere. But the bill i received nothing is visible on it.,Not charge fast..not looks 20w charger..cable are good,well,I purchased it to copy stuff from my phone to USB and vice versa. It works well for that purpose. The fitting is perfect and no connection issues.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71JnAsJtMUL._SY88.jpg,Good product.,Working fine Amazon should provide 2 mtr cable length, very good quality,Nice item, received in good packaging.,The cables is perfectly working and there is no color difference with it.,It works perfectly with GTX 1650 Super (Asus TUF) and DELL 2520D with single desktop across dual monitor setup (multi-stream). The trick to figuring out is how the cable fits your DP port, both sides. This fit in snugly with GTX and I knew this is gonna work. No need to do any voodoo with pulling cables, powering off this and that, to make DP cable work, just works straight out of the box.Strangely, this cable didn\\'t support my Logitech G603 (wireless gaming mouse) Lightspeed connection. The dongle is attached to the 1st of the two DELL 2520D Monitors. Mouse works when I am viewing over Type-C PD Display with my Laptops. Otherwise Audio, Video, resolution , refresh rates didn\\'t bother.Durability could be a question, let\\'s wait and observe over the days. A lot have commented that this cable didn\\'t last long.,Best in the budget.,This is not Vesa certified cable. sometimes the monitor  goes black for 3 to 4 second.,,The product is good, Its been almost a week I am using this cable. I am using a LG 24GM77 Monitor (1080p 144Hz) As soon as I installed this cable the display went on default refresh rate (60 Hz). Then I went into windows display settings (as Nvidia settings didn\\'t have refresh rate more than 60 Hz) to change the refresh rate to 144 Hz and it switched without any issues. Avoid jerks to the monitor as I figured the display goes off for a brief 1 or 2 secs post jerking. Rest the cable quality is good, However locks to the display ports could be appreciated. Rest all is fine. I hope this review might be helpful. Thank you. It\\'s very good peace what I read.,Institutions free is very expensive and difficult prasasan but thanks for Amazon,My review is after 2 months of buyExcellent Mi Tv 55inchI like the its built quality.Picture quality is osm and working good no issue with display 55 inch is much big and in dark looks like theater experienceSound quality better and much loud, bass is good with 40w speakerWorking good with no issue and Android with no lag good storage with all ports with Dolby vision hdr 10No issue with pachtwallConsI face an issue with Chromecast, i think i should be solved on tv updateOther all features are amazingMust buy it ....,Good,Nice clarity good product,Good tv for reasonable rate. So far the tv is working fine and the picture quality is also excellent. Sound quality is also good but low compared to Sony or Samsung, anyways I have connected to sound bar so that does not matter me anymore. Voice recognition and commands work fine. All in all its a good tv to buy.I am only disappointed about is that i had ordered tv with 8gb internal memory but i got was 4gb. I really dont understand the logic behind it.,Good for low budget peopels,,After 3 months my tv screen gone. It’s doesn’t support Alexa (What is mentioned in product description, it’s wrong),Excellent purchase. Feeling the videos are little bit darker. Any body can help me to set it in a good clarity video. Like which mode i have to select, brightness level, contrast level,......,A master piece has arrived from sansui.excellent picture quality. sound quality for a medium sized room is too good. was astonished to hear its sound for the first time.people tends to go for sony lg samsung, but have a look at this tv before shelling out atleast 10000 more bucks for a branded one. I also have sony, marq and tcl tvs. except sony, it can compete with other higher end brands too.wl use it for six months and wl update further.installation was not done from vecare even after scheduling but amazon on complaining sent to install on the same day.In nutshell, superb VFM tv from a renowned old brand.got a 55 inch variant for 29000 rs during sale.,Picture quality ok sounds good,Quality of the picture iis ok,In this price picture quality is good.sound quality big drawback..rest all good#bang for a buck,Good purchase... meets expectations on picture and sound...and very competitively priced...should have RCA outlets also.,Service to be made available at doorstep Good compatible product,Like,Remote is working nicely just the up button and down button is working a little slow else is fine,This button is very soft,Originality. Used as remote control,The buttons are very hard,Best Remote u can get👍👍,No syncing needed, just put batteries in and use it After 1-2 months , it has become worse and my phone dosent charge or takes too much time like 11 to 12 hours. Sometimes it doesnt even connect to the phone.Dont buy it, dont buy any other cheap cables. Prefer the branded ones, they will be expensive but worth your money and time.,Okay but not supprting 18 w fast charging,Fast charging,i like verymuch,,Charger worked for hardly 20 days after delivery.,Nice Charging Cable for Samsung m30, 👍,works very well and its still going great even after 3 months of use ! It supports PD and it has a solid build quality, have a couple of them and it\\'s been good so far ! Go for it blindly,Decent product, I have tested with my samsung s20 FE, it is supporting fast charging. I hope the cable is durable, I will update my review in future if I face any further issues.,Worth the price.,Belkin name is enough I think.It’s very nice and sturdy.Breading over it make it premium too.Very nice to have one.,good quality,Instead of buying one cable every year or carrying torn cables, just buy this. I think this is a lifetime investment. The ends are covered so well that they will never tear.,Good quality at an affordable price. Just got delivered, there’s lag in remote, it takes like 2-3 secs after pressing the remote key.Like I said, when you can’t find the original remote to buy this can be handy.,No voice communication,It is acceptable for the price ( INR 399 )  , works as intended , however buttons require additional force as it\\'s hard.,The best thing about the remote is , obviously, that it worked. No problems, just put in the batteries(which, honestly, should have been included) and it worked. The flip side is that the fit and finish is atrocious. It\\'s so badly finished, that when i first saw it i thought it was a fake..it couldn\\'t possibly be real..but..for the price, and the function, it was perfect.,Not good, because far not remote TV.Near TV only,voice recognition is not available with this remote control so i return the item rest item is good for rest of the things.,Good Remote IR CENSOR AND GOOD BUY. Instead of buying Bluetooth one you can buy this one with affordable price.,ok for emergency , keys are hard and might not work after 6 months but is compatile with tcl android 32 inch tv Affordable, available and multi purpose cable best suitable for traveling and reducing overall cables to carry,Warking fine 🙂 build also good,It is a nice cable as it fits in most of the phones and devices.Sturdy one, no fear of damage by wear and tear.However, I felt that the cable is heated up substantially with higher currents.This uncommon in standard phone cables provided by OEMs.,I have been using this cable from last few months and very much satisfied with the this product and i recommend to go for it.,The cable quality is very good. Charging time is good with availability of different cable types.,Considering the price compared to competitors at market, this is cheap, but no compromises have been made with respect to sturdiness or quality. The wires are wonderful, despite using it for more over a month now, no issues at all were faced regarding wire tangling, torn out wires etc. Very sturdy and pretty easy to carry.Regarding charging speed, it delivers what it promised. The quality of the ports are also solid, no issue had been faced at all.Packaging was great, performance of the product even greater. The wires are long enough, though in my personal opinion, a little bit more lengthy would be icing on the cake, making the product absolutely a perfect one!Overall, very happy with purchasing it. A great VFM product for all those having multiple type devices with them. This one single cable has a solution to charging it all!,Warp Charge is working fine and satisfactory. Lightning cable is working in normal condition rather than Fats charging.But overall the product is awesome and felt 100% value for money.,like Shown 2 pieces, received only one. Also it\\'s not 6ft at all as mentioned. Did feel cheated. Charging is ok. The reason i opted for this is Just that I needed one iPhone charger with USB port.,It is actually set of 2 three feet cables, both working fine for me. Bought for emergency use and having no issues after a month.,Bought 2months back only.product is good,Nice and value for money,Good product but be prepared for long lead time,Misleading Title and descriptionIt’s not 6ft cable,Better to use original item,Just bought it so not sure of durability or sturdiness but it was very cheap and so wasn’t sure how good will it work but it works perfectly fine Good Packaging.. Wire Quality is Good.,Very good quality but the wire is 15 meters only at least should be 20 meters for the price......😓,I am using this with an F&D A140x as my satellite speakers\\' wires were getting very flimsy. Out of the box these cables are very thick compared to the ones my speakers had before.After replacing the cables with these ones I noticed two things right away1. My speakers are louder2. The sound quality is much betterOne thing you wanna be careful is that these cables stick out like a sore thumb in front of white walls, so if you are like me who cares about the looks, you might wanna cover these with cable raceways or even paint them like I am planning to do.,Wire is very best quality but cost not worth for it,Durability n quality is absolutely good.,The product is 16 gauge pure copper multi thread wires. Sound quality is impressive.Bears a Black band for +ve/-ve distinction,I\\'ve seen many reviews where people complain that this cable is not Copper, its Aluminium and even some saying its fake. So I thought I\\'ll clear some doubts about this product.ITS TRUE! This is not a pure Copper cable, its Copper clad Aluminium. Infact most of the speaker cables are Copper clad Aluminium. Majority of the audio signal travel through the outer edge of the conductor (skin effect), hence the Copper cladding. Thicker the cladding, better the audio quality, this cable only got a thin cladding of Copper The Steel/Aluminium reinforced center is for a more durable conductor. Now no where in the description Amazon has mentioned that this is a pure Copper cladding cable, so just need to get your expectations right. You simply cannot expect Oxygen free pure Copper cable at this price (Rs 400). You will not find a decent 16 gauge Copper speaker cable for less than Rs 2000.This is a cheap 16 gauge speaker and it does the job very well. This cable is more than enough to deliver good sound to your speakers. Cable quality is average but you get what you pay for. Now if got some high end speakers, then I won\\'t recommend this cable.,Good Everything is fine but it is bulky and hard, it should be softer and thinner.....,Thank you  Amazon very good charging cable 👍,Good,Good one,quality is good. worth for 150-200 ₹. short but durable.,Very Good product . Satisfied..,This is fast charging C pin USB!You can purchase it.,Nice product at price of below 100 I purchased the cable for my Galaxy Note 9 in July 2022. Have been using it since and it works neat. The cable is tough due to its braided nature.,Overall good for usage, not faced any quality issues. C point section is also good to fit properly in mobile. You can go for it.,Most expensive cable I have ever purchased. Probably the best cable too. Giving 1 star less for the premium pricing.I bought this as the long cables dont work well with Android Car. This works very well. Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ₹309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won\\'t come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars, I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn\\'t charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use, the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ₹300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality, the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle, I am sure I will put it through some abuse and I can comment on the same when I revisit this review for updates.Durability:I will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective, as my first Wayona dash charge cable I used for Oneplus 6 died in 3 months. But thankfully it was replaced under warranty. That shows how good the support is from Wayona team. I only had to record that the cable died and doesn\\'t charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product.Verdict:If you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on  or for charging devices from powerbanks, I would definitely recommend this cable.,Data transfer is quite fast, and also, compatible with my QC adapter.,Good,Excellent... Worth for the money,Nice wire, fast charge. My 32 inch tv fits fine, also 55 inch TV can be wall mount for sure. Good product quality. Various sizes  screws and nuts included in this product,Nice product,I am giving 3 stars because screws provide in the product do not fit properly. I had to get it separately to install.,I love to like it’s accuracy of fitting.,I had to makeshift the screws to fit the grill as the screws were long and had to add washer to make it fit.,I installed my self,It perfectly fit on my Sony TV (32 inch). Stand is sturdy and good. Deducting 1 start as I don\\'t see anything on the sides of the stand which can prevent my TV from falling on side, so I had to little bit bend the sides of stand so that TV doesn\\'t fall, if someone pulls it from left or right. Otherwise it\\'s a good stand.,Nothing to write. It\\'s a basic universal stand. Expensive here on Amazon. Turns out, the same thing was from 200 at a local hardware / electronic/light store All is good except little loose cover,I ordered this specifically for the colour. It fits okay. The product catches lot of dust.,priced over is Item,Nice product,It was a bit overpriced but a good quality product. I did not receive the same blue color as showed in the description but received some glowing light blue colour which glows in dark.,Remote stops working after 3 months,Nice fit. Volume buttons should also be covered with transperant layer as symbols get wornbout over time,It is smooth, made with rubber.Perfectly fits to my remote. Ok with that price but has issues with power button and no voice support,Good,Good,Mic is not working,Voice not working. You can\\'t enable voice assistant in this remote.,Quality is average, the buttons are not smooth and the range is not good. But overall it is functioning,Very nice,Using it for 3 days now, after my original remote conked off after 14 months and VU quoted Rs 2000 for a new remote.In this remote  except for the voice control everything works perfectly. Can’t comment on durability in 3 days but as of now I am happy with this purchase. Good Stuff... Recommended!!!,Need better quality for changing,Good product,I bought it 7 months. Ago it still working in good condition good 😊,good cable to by in budjet,The cable is of very good quality. Charging speed is good for my Redmi k20 pro which support 27 watt fast charging good thing is that the battery backup improved when charge with this cable I’m really surprise I observed this with many time as I test it with with original cable and result is the same. If this is in ur budget then just buy it don’t hesitate,Reliable, strong,Nil It\\'s a good data cable and I recommend it to purchase,the only issue was the metal pin is not fixed firmly so it has become loose,otherwise no issue,must purchase,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SgnWv1ML._SY88.jpg,Charging cable which is sturdy it\\'s not a fast charging cable but the three outlets does the job.,Good sturdy micro usb cable with good charging speeds. Please don\\'t raise prices,Nice product, a simpla microusb cable,😂,Best for this price,Good one Not too good not too bad,If you have the trust of Amazon basics then go for it. I am writing this review after using it for 18 months. Still as sturdy and durable as the new one.,Nil,Used it for a fortnight till now in my car for mobile charging. Works well.,Not working with Fast Charger , if you are planning to use with normal charger , its pretty good . Product quality too its GOOD.,I\\'m using this cable since 1 years and currently this cable is running perfectly without any problems.If you want to buy best type-c cable then without thinking buy it.,Does not support display only work to connect network and charging,Good and useful Excellent product,It\\'s just a day old now. Look wise, it\\'s good, sturdy and durable china product. It says 60w capable, don\\'t know how to measure it but works good with my 25wats brick.,The charging cable stopped working within 2 weeks. I opted for a basic and cheaper charging cable but all the money went in waste. Now I will have to buy another good quality cable,Build Quality best in market and the cable provides a fast charging with 25 W charger too,Very slow charging , didn’t expect from Croma,Durable and fast,I couldn\\'t connect it to Samsung mobile,Fast charge The delivery people were not careful with the unpacking. Amazon needs to train their delivery staff on unpacking different types of things since they have come up with a policy where they need to open the package and verify any defects. 2 stars to them as they are not careful with the unpacking. I could see that they were holding the TV panel while getting the TV out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they weren\\'t. Also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the Screen.Howerver very satisfied with the Sony Installation. The engineer has good hands on and very experienced with the installation.,TV picture quality is good. WiFi connection is little slow but it works mostly fine if router is nearby. Delivery was good and fast. The Sony installation service is very poor near Bengaluru. Guy came late, next day to scheduled day that too after calling many times. He came and went like a bullet doesn\\'t tell most of the things about TV like need to update system and all.But overall TV works fine. We have 65 inch Bravia.,(Song TV contacted after this review and resolved all below issue Thank u sony TV)Picture  and sound quality is very good  its to good but in software so many bugs ( wifi auto connectivity issue need to connect your same  wifi again and again , sound setting after conecting sound bar need If we selected Speaker audio system then need to use 2 remotes to do sound adjustment , in My Mi TV I am using only TV remote to adjust sound and aame connectivity  same soundbar,  Unable to connect soundbar via bluetooth (IN Mi TV same sound bar connected easly)Remote size is so big so many falatu keys in remote like 1 ro 9 no keys fast forward keys etc and in down side blank space. And aftrr software update I seen little picture quality low as compare before software update.,The tv is great at this purchase price. Sony tvs are generally very adaptive. Colour and picture qualty is really good. Sound is nice as well. Would however advise to use external speakers with a tv of such size.,If you don’t wish to purchase a sound bar, go for this model. The picture quality is beautiful, works with apple play, it’s a win win. I got the 43” for my bedroom on a great offer. And yeah, it’s a Sony. A wonderful purchase, absolutely worth it.,Best TV in its segment! Outstanding built quality. Sony TV may seem little bulky compared to some other fancy TVs but I have seen over the years that they never compromise on quality.I was little skeptical about picture clarity since it is big (65\") TV but found it better than expected. Sound quality is also very good for a LED TV. Non HD channels are little less clear (not bad though; still it is good) but it\\'s obvious seeing screen size.,Has complained on TV getting struck. Their dealer called while i was driving. Requested to call/ visit for TV reset later.Their service manager came into conference call, listened over.  He advised dealer to treat the service call as closed without issue being resolved and dealer/ service centre till date not resolved issue.  Our TV is still getting hung sometimes and we are managing by restarting tv every time,I have recently bought the 43-inch model. The picture & sound quality is good. It does not come with an anti-glare coating. Do not install the TV in front of the window. The remote is so far good and works smoothly with a slight click. No need to press too hard, just a soft click required without any effort. It should be better if there would be Netflix, Prime, and YouTube buttons but at this price range it seems fine with me. It connects through infrared rays rather than Bluetooth but works absolutely fine. This  remote is for Mi 4A 43, 32 and other similar Mi models. If your Mi tv doesn\\'t have Bluetooth then this remote is perfect for you at this price.,Make sure you put in fresh brand new batteries..,Best quality give me remote,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tCj98QIdL._SY88.jpg,Product is good is cheap but at the same time usefull. Must buy,Faster delivery … product quality is very good Thanks 😊💯,Nice product,It works only when you are one feet away from TV. Doesn\\'t serve the purpose.in one word it do not know the meaning of word remote Good as,Good,Bought us a backup remote for Vu Premium smart TV. It is fully compatible. The remote does not have microphone, so Google Assistant do not work.,The keys are of rubber..  not like the original one... But not bad,Plz don\\'t buy, very poor quality & within a month buttons not working properly....,Working fine as expected,Buttons are not working properly !! Only 40% works rest are just part of design instead go for a original one !!,Buttons are so hard to press Cable is working propely but the price is on a higher side.,Good Quality,Cable was too short,Hello everyone,Do not go for this .beacuse it says 5gbs transfer speed but it has a very slow speed in comparison to the original cable I got from Seagate company. my original cable shows the cut and copies speed to SSD like 30 to 150mbs ps per second. But this cable does around 10 to 80mbs  mostly. The cable is also very thin in size, the original Seagate had is very thick and sturdy.  At the end speed matters.so if u have like 2 or 4TB external hard drive it will load slowly after connecting, folders keep loading and loading. So, I would rather suggest to please go with a 10 GBS speed cable which will have a 3.1 type c cable.,Worth the money,Plug fits little tight to the port, might damage the port on longer use. But does the job well.,It is a good product. Works with all the laptops and hard drives. Value for money. Recomended product,GOOD Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It\\'s great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item. Nice product,Okay product at Cheap price. But very high delivery charges even for prime customers. Quality is not great (cheap plastic) but does its purpose.,Worth for money.. but it\\'s light weight so only for setop box stabilizers other over weights can\\'t carry,but you cannot put big remote in its pocket,Nice product,Value for money,super product s,It was sent without screws. Disappointed abt that. But overall sturdy. Will update. Screw size shown in image. ,Screen quality is good.It\\'s been a month I bought it still working fine.Two main negatives are1• It doesn\\'t have default option to directly start on tata sky tv, we have to select hdmi option from input menu to select tata sky which one is plugged in.2• dosent allow us to command/choose volume up or down from set-top box remote (mine tata sky)We have use tv remove to change the volume setting.Other than that great tv, mine ps4 works fine with it great graphics.Conclusion: If someone ask\\'s me to if they Can buy it or notMine answer will be nor yes nor no.If we you want kinda cheap but decent  quality tv and taking the risk on unknown tv brand on their reliability( just like me ) then go for it.Better then Samsung or Sony ??? Definitely no!!.,I always buy and recommend Samsung Sony or LG for TV. But, I had a hard budget this time and chose Vu because my friends have been using it for at least 4-5 years without much issues.While the delivery and installation were excellent, and TV on the whole is a decent package which gives good clarity than the rival Chinese TVs and Sound, smart features are poor here.You can connect Bluetooth headphones but no option to disconnect them. I had to pair and unpair everytime.There is no voice command button on remote. Even while using the screen button for voice input, nothing gets recognised. My 3k Fire stick voice recognition was tooo good.,I purchased VU gloled 55 inches TV after suggestion from my techie friends and online study. Technician from amazon came to my home for installation in drunken mode. But I compromised with him due to busy schedule of work. He installed tv with his small screws instead of VU standard wall screws. He did whatever he want. Proper installation was not performed.I just calm down then later i gave a complaint to amazon and VU Customer services. Amazon was not properly responded till now. But from VU side i got a huge response of problem solving. Min 3 to 4 customercare executives spoke with me, finally VU\\'s vice President mr prashanth phoned me and apologized me for inconvenience happened to me. He told drunken technician is not from VU. I feel good for VU\\'s Top level executives have interaction with me. From bottom to top level VUs Team in touch with me for a month to resolve my issue due to i stayed away from home. Before few days back technician came to my home again from vu. He reinstalled my tv in perfect position with dedication. I never expect this much customer friendly behaviour from VU Thank you very much VU. Kudos to VU Team... Good Built Quality + Clear Audio + Value for Money,I purchased this cable to connect my phone to my Onkyo home theatre system as it supports only RCA aux. the cable quality is good and is gold plated. Though I have just purchased the cable so cannot comment on its durability. Though this comes with 2 years warranty card hence don’t anticipate any issues,Good quality product. Sound output is a bit low due to Aux pin. Atleast its connected to LG tv aux output.,Sound is great,Good product,Very good product,Comes in good package.. value of moneyGood quality cable with 24 months limited warrantyMust recommendValue of money,Quality is superb. The audio is crisp and clear. A good choice to go to Cable is long and durable. Its worth the purchase.,I recommend this product whoever needs a sturdy and fast charging also keep in mind your charger needs to support while using this cable,After seeing the reviews I ordered for this product for my Samsung S9 mobile. Although the cable is very steady and good it fails the main purpose. When I keep my mobile for charging the cable pin is very tight and I fear while putting and removing my mobile charging chip would break as it is very tight. I am looking for another alternative.So if you are looking for a charger for S9 Samsung mobile PLEASE FO NOT BUY IT.,Good,Superb,I have oneplus 6 mobile phone and have dash charger and oneplus cable which becomes a fast charging combo.However when i plugged in this cable with dash charger. It was not rapidly charging my phone. So I can\\'t say if this is fast charging cable ot not.But as a common charging cable this is working perfectly fine,This is one of the best cable for fast charging. I have 3 units of 2 meter c type cable. I don\\'t think it will get damage soon. The quality is very good and charging S22 ultra, Galaxy note 8 etc without any problem. Thanks to China,Standard Product. Worth the money..... Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product This is my third time which purchasing a lightning cable though this is my first time Iam using Amazon basics lightning cable it’s comparatively looks more durability than other brands normally other brands are worn out with in a year and I tested product there’s no flaw in charging and bending of the cable,one of the cheap solution for apple users,A useful product for those wanting a longish cord length.Reasonable charging speed.,Feels premium, the wire quality is good and overall a not bad cable, would be my very next order if apple cable is too expensive,Was looking for a sturdy and reliable cable for my iPhone 13 without any compromise on quality to be used in my car for Apple Car Play. This cable delivers the quality I expected and works like a charm.,stopped working .. want to claim warranty how it can be done ??,Value for money item,Excellent Product Good quality cable.,I had projector flickering issues while connectIng to my 2018 MacBook pro 13” with a third party Usb C to HDMI adapter, extended by other high end HDMI cable to a Epson projector. I tried to reset NVRAM & reset The System Magement Controller (SMC) of the MacBook but neither worked. At last purchased this amazon basics cable and now it connects without any flickering and displays all HD content played on YouTube, prime video and iTunes.,Good quality. Used it as extension cable between Amazon 4k Fire Stick and TV.,Very durable and good quality.,The quality of this piece is very good. The cable is almost as thick as a Pilot pen (image attached) and there is no degradation in quality. Ofcourse I am no professional and have not made any accurate measurements; just commenting on what it is like for a normal eye. If you need to run a long cable (6ft may not be long enough for living rooms in which case I think the 10ft one will be more helpful), buy this and enjoy the peace of mind.,Male to Female HDMI Extension Cable purchased through Amazon is working well for connecting my Laptop to TV set and I have not faced any problem until now. Feel happy.,i like that very much, before i ordered 3feet amazonbasics hdmi wire and that was very nice , now this wire is much better than before, much thicker wire, recommend that,Performing great so far.... Using it more than couple of years from now... Sturdy packing, good product!,Have used this brand cable for my iPhone and iPad before, so when my wife\\'s Samsung charger cable gave up the ghost in less than 6  months, I ordered this. Braided, visibly high quality cable, unlike the flimsy and highly overpriced OEM cables from Apple and Samsung. I have been using my iPhone cable from Wayona for more than 1 1/2 years and still going strong.  Hope this C cable will give a similar performance,I like Wayona chords and especially the long ones. But I get a slight shock - like a static discharge - when I touch my phone while charging with these two cords. Other cords with same charger are okay.,Ok,Cable looks solid and length is also good.Little bit fast charging I observed for phones like Redmi.It also looks solid so I am expecting it to work for atleast 1 year,build quality and fast charging feature,Unbreakable, good quality,Cable a Nice Product Recently ordered other. Usb for just 150 rsThe charging speed was same.This is not my main usb i use apple orignal onesHowever it seems like i over paid for getting the made for iphone tag,Product is built well, better than the Apple’s charging cable. This isn’t working with the charging adapters but works well with the power banks.,Charging time is okay as totally depends on adapter which we are using,If someone is looking for alternative to the expensive Apple Brand charging cables then this product will be the right choice.,Awesome product, I use this frequently inside my car. Writing this after 2 months of regular usage.,Alternate charging cable.,Good one for iPhone - Lightning Charge.,The Cable is helpful for connecting your iPhone to your car for CarPlay. The mouse feature of the remote is not working,Remote control with push button seems to be ok but no voice recognition and no ray pointer as in the original LG product..would like a refund for misrepresentation on the website..you have amended the description after my complaint.,Best product,Number buttons are not working,Defective product, it is not working with the tv,Dislike the product as it doesn’t have pointer option,Not working properly,Best option to buy since it\\'s hard to get replacement of OLED tv remote.... Everything is great. I love this.,Very good and working very nice,First of all, thanks to Amazon for listing it as a returnable item and at an effective cost of less than 3k.Coming to the device itself, the reason for purchasing it is to experience Google TV. On that account, the interface is more useful than the standard Android TV one in terms of discovery, but the listed content is not that relevant.However, it is Realme that lets the user down. The device was bug ridden from the beginning and they basically abandoned the device in 6 months, with the last software update in Feb 2022, still riddled with bugs and never to see Google TV 12.The stick heats up enough to scald you if you touch it and it stutters like crazy after usage of over a day, in part due to the lackluster A35 ARM cores which is lacking in performance compared to A53 cores present in sticks from over 7 years ago, and also due to poor RAM management.Only reason to get it would be for the price, if it is less than 3k, but be prepared to suffer through a laggy interface and the known issues of the remote failing within a few months. Still males more sense to get a Fire TV stick which is more refined and receives more updates, although the interface is a love or hate it one.For the Google TV experience, it is better to go with Google TV with Chrome cast but that costs a bomb in India, for what it offers.,Got ( used ) product.It was trapped and also proformance is twice degrade to fire stick also not sucking wifi well as computer to Fire Stick About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the \\'so called free\\' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it\\'s pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It\\'s awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can\\'t use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it\\'s a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It\\'s running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it\\'s good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn\\'t happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(₹11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money Quality issue..,Good,Cable length is ok , quality is not good . In this price it is ok,Very good & quality product. Reasonable price alsoYour cable easy to replace.,Best quality,Good product but thickness of cable is less,It is very good product.Thank you amazon,Super product Good,Good quality product,Affordable hdmi cable,Not working,Great product, the length is perfect, quality is really good. The built quality is also good.The output through this cable is also very good, it doesn\\'t affect the output as much as other local cables.Great product to buy for your pc, laptop, gaming stations, and also projectors.,Good product,Its still working the same after using it for 2 months.,As per expectations. Hence, it\\'s value for money, maintain quality of picture etc. Atlast  I connected successfully. Working good. But sound volume & clarity not adequate. Durability, to be assessed.  Dear amazon.in, tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearly.Manual printing also is bad. I had to struggle.,Does what it says. Works well to connect two Bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop, smart TV, etc. Can take a bit of time to pair two devices. But the manual in the box helps.Sound quality over aux cable too is good. So, even if you do not have a digital output or RCA you can still use it. Bit bit flimsy and delicate. But then you don\\'t need to move it around everyday.,Disadvantage - the sound and video lag with distance while connecting Bluetooth with headphones.Pairing with headphones difficult (need to wait long)Feels volumes low.,,I got this to add-on to a high-end system, which traditionally doesn\\'t have the facility. However it\\'s often requested when guests come over. I was using a Phoenix transreceiver, but the constant need of charging and the single indicator LED made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application. The optical out is connected to a dual ESS9028 DAC, and the device used for transmission is the iPad Air.This lacks a battery, which is a big differentiator. This means it is not exactly portable, and the form factor reinforces that \\'feature\\'. It is intended to be a desktop unit, and it comes with a reasonable set of cables. The quality of the included cables is quite poor, so it\\'s best to use something else.Compared to the direct input from USB, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. Still, this is being used in a high-end system - I suspect with many lesser speaker/amp/DACs it will be acceptable. At maximum output, the level is about 1-2dB lower than a direct USB connection to the DAC.It is around the same as my Signature Acoustics unit, which is 1/3rd the size but uses a battery, and doesn\\'t have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.The bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both BT and another optical source/receiver - though only either can be used at a time.The build quality is average. It is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards, hence the thin cables supplied. The onboard volume control is nice, if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume (I use the DAC remote). It also has only 16 clicks, so the control will be very coarse. The display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.Overall, it\\'s quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. The sound quality limitations of BT transmission (compulsory resampling and lossy compression, among others) cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols, so I\\'d rank it close to the top of what you can get as an add-on for a hifi system. For more \\'normal\\' usage, there are cheaper options available.,Excellent product,Bluetooth range is very less,Bought it to connect my old Sony 5.1 blueray home theater with MI 4k box which does not have Optical sound port. It has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in Everything is fine but sound quality should be little bit more enhanced. After viewing the price it is also good,Awesome product,FM Radio antenna isn\\'t strong enough, rest features are value for money,Tower Speakers are big but the size of this is not big . Sounds r good . I recommend if the size was big then the sounds will better .,Product is good,,Best,Awesome speaker quality, tooo loud speaker with clean and clear clarity, FM needs to tuned but in this price no one will provide this quality of speakers. Single speaker Beat entire home theatre or surround system. Tv working good, the screen is VA type, if we want to see good picture we need to maintain minimum distance to tv because this tv pixels are so big. But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV\\'s colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it\\'s sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.,Writing  review after 1.5 month use overall good but it become little slow when we install apps rest everything is fine. I liked it and i think you also love it if your budget is in this range.,First fall I was take as buy a acer tv, then I have fear because acer tv is new brand and if any problem with tv serving. But after purchased and  using my fear was goes. Because tv functions is good. And warranty also available.,Overall its a  good product, some times it lags and once it got auto restarted.but company has lied to customers with that there is 16 gb of space in the TV which is not therestill i like the picture and sound quality,I am very happy when I order this tv. I have purchased it on Diwali. When we start to use this tv, we found that to use the cromecast feature I need to install a third party app which is not support to my mobile phone (samsung M21). I am very disappointed now  for this feature but what can i do now. It has good and loud sound system. My overall experience is not meet to my expectations.,I regret not having gotten a larger size. This is an amazing smart tv, clear view and awesome sound. 4 stars only because I couldnt get jio universal remote to work with it.,Under 15k best smart Android TV everything is perfect  like sound, picture quality, Bluetooth connectivity and wifi. Connectivity,Finally a budget friendly smart TV  for middle class people who is having 30k salary per month. Picture quality- Ok Ok,  Sound- super, warnty- best, remote - simple over all nice one. No product is perfect in all segments, this one also not an exception. Good quality,As mentioned in the product details the loop is not provided. The quality of the item looks average.,It fits perfectly on remote. Its Worth for the money I spent.,Good product . Value for money.,Good product,I would not say this as a value for money product. But it fits fine on the alexa remote. The fit is little clumsy towards top of the remote compared to rest of the areas.,If you also hate covering your remote with plastic covers, this is for you. Good quality, reasonable pricing and designed ergonomically.,Nice product Good,,Quality of cable is good and fast charging and customer care support very helpful,Simply the best cable.. works really well with fast charging brick,Don’t buy if you have problem with loose pin…its pin is same as oroginal iPhone pin…but the wire quality is good…if you want to take for that…it just took 2 months for thier pin to break,Awesome charging wire,Awesome quality and fast charging,The product works fine. It is able to deliver fast charging when connected to a 20W charger. The cable is durable unlike the Apple OE cable.

I have been using this Digital TV HD Set top box since a month with no problems, also weather was good since then and I will check it in bad weather conditions also because mostly these STB\\'s give problems in bad weather conditions, till now it\\'s working fine.,Okay good product,I like this product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-DOYZcjyL._SY88.jpg,Nice sarvice Ok,Very disappointedRange is not good it doesn\\'t catch from a little far and it doesn\\'t support Bluetooth and untill and unless it is not connected to set top box via bluetooth voice search will not work.Also yo can\\'t return you can only replace it.😡,Very bad product never connect only,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/819V40EpT2L._SY88.jpg,No bluetooth Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\\'t perfectly black - and they\\'re brighter than you\\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\\'t produce the contrast you\\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\\'t even use your phone\\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\\'d say I\\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\\'t change my decision. It\\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec\\'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don\\'t have voice recognition. I don\\'t require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It\\'s clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall.

I hope after few updates the lags problem will be resolved,Useless product and useless quality. Display issues within 7 months and service center is not upto the mark.

But it\\'s working fine with my MI 55 \" smart tv,First delivery remote control wasn\\'t working.After replacement request received new RC, but  within 8 days volume buttons stopped working.Pathetic experience.How will Amazon compensate this ??,Nice,Good It has been a week since we bought the 43\" LED TV. Its definitely a value for Money buy. Good Picture and Sound quality, loaded with abundant Apps and Features.The Flip side is the Installation time, as has been mentioned by others in earlier posts. It took several calls to the Toshiba customer service (very laidback and definitely not pro-active). Final escalation to the Service Head worked and by then it was 3 days since the Product arrived and was lying still!Product wise no complaint. Delivery wise no complaint.,This product am recived 5days...

Poor compatibility.,Nice experiance,,Files transfer okSuper fast charging cable goodMeets my expectation.,Very great Quality,Just purchased and using. Charging ok. Future, I can\\'t say.,Good I have a pd supported car charger and I bought solimo cables previously which work perfectly fine but this one doesn\\'t trigger full 3A fast charging unlike solimo usb a to usb c, which is strange because this is supposed to be a 65W charger with 4A fast charging support.Anyways it\\'s a good built product and works but not as expected. It might be compatible with your chargers but I tested 2 different car chargers and both didn\\'t go full speed. There\\'s no magic remote and lg should include it by default as it makes life easier. The magic remote costs around 3k approximately.Display: when turned on tv and tested the display on black wallpaper found very small green and white dots.Immediately called up Amazon first and then we scheduled a tech visit.The tech did not come rather spoke on call and asked what\\'s the problem and when informed about the problem he said needs to be replaced but no body came with it.So i waited for 2 days again and nothing was showing up on Amazon app about replacement so doubting it I called up Amazon customer care again and explained everything again and finally spoke to some one and she said she will get it replaced and i was given another date within 4 days.This time the replacement came and was good.,Amazing picture quality and sound clarity, but only drawback is that it did not come with a Magic remote.,The television is good but the installation service is pathetic first of all they did not contact us till 2 days after the TV delivery and we got frustrated and call LG customer service and they accepted our problem and send a technician after 2 hours and while installing the mount he installed 3 bolts successfully but he broke the last bolt and we asked him will it not cause a problem in future he said it wouldn\\'t but we don\\'t really believe him.,Good,Very nice good quality best in this price,Nice choice,Best deal,I like LGWorth for price.

(Old one habe 6 keys on right side panel) only have one on off switch.. Others in remote only!!Now lets see how many years it runs... +Point is it has optical port (thomsan and kodak both mfg by simtronic india ltd),Picture and sound quality is very good. Allover nice product. Vallu for money.,Very nice,VGA port is not present, display quality is not good. Good product 👍🏻,Nice products and easy to use.very good quality and the product is very good 😊,,Simply Go for it.I have been using this almost for the last 1.5 years. I have been using this every day, the whole day during office hours, and sometimes work at home both for my Phone and Laptop using with 65-watt charger.It is trouble-free and does its job as we expect it to do. No problem whatsoever.The big plus point with this cable is that it does not entangle to develop constant fold that becomes cracks over a period of time. This is the issue that I had with other cables. This one is perfect.As I said, You can simply go for it. Strongly recommended.,Best,The length could have been longer,Value for money,Godd quality material and fast charging I bought this remote as My original remote of Fire tv 4k stopped working. This remote works OK OK. so when it works it is interesting,I get the right bottom popup note from Fire TV that the battery is too low in the remote even if the batteries are new.If you are in urge to go to specific show and play it, sudden it stopps responding to the remote. and all of a sudden your thumbnails keeps scrolling without you doing anything. so the response is in accurate some times.When it is working alright some times, it goes well without any issues. So don\\'t know what to say. If you want to put 2k extra and buy the original , i suggest you do that. if you are running short on money and not feeling to put that amount for original and you can adjust with the above mentioned issues. then you are good to go with this one. All the best on your buy guys. Cheers!,You\\'ve to press too hard,Not as responsive as the previous one. Need to press harder.No real problems though.,nice product,Thankfully got this to replace firesticks remote which malfunctioned very soon.this option is best fit at best cost .Voice control as well works well,Not an original remote.

Overall a good product.,Amazing product to buy .,I ordered this product seeing the high cost with perception it must be worth of its price. But, the product is cheap Chinese plastic crap and definitely not a worth more than rs. 500 at most.  In the end, it\\'s a cheap Chinese product sold in India at rs. 2600+ which is not even worth of more than rs. 500. Better if you go for some other not very costly and simple vr set under max rs. 1000 or either a expensive  vr set of very reputed makers if you\\'re dire enthusiast.Amazon services and customer support is exceptional and here i believe that\\'s what make them on top.CAUTION : this product has no refund policy.

I use it along with my set up box & fire tv stick. Works seamlessly,ery good build quality and performance. It works well with my HP laptop. The HDMI jack fits with a satisfying click into the laptop, so the fit is perfect.Since this is an adapter only, you will need to connect this to your monitor\\'s VGA cable (duh!).

I would recommend other too to use this product.This product is very helpfulHDMI to VGA adapter connects a computer, desktop, laptop, or other devices with HDMI port to a monitor, projector, HDTV, or other devices with VGA port,I used this  product for laptop to old monitor interface and it is working good,Works fine, affordable and sturdy. Also, I didn\\'t notice any lag in the hdmi-to-vga conversion. Additional trivia: Contrary to what\\'s mentioned in product description, country of origin is China, not India 😊.,The convertor works well without any issues in connection but the output quality is not as good as the direct VGA connection that I use with my another laptop.,The cable seems to be of good quality material. Adapter is sturdy and connects well, working smoothly till now in my lenovo laptop and projector. Good packaging also. Recommended product in this price range. Good quality,Good product,Average,No operation button in television which is big irritate when the remote not working,In simple words, Please don’t buy this MI TV and especially from Amazon/this seller (Sold by Cloudtail India and Fulfilled by Amazon).If you have patience and able to understand normal English(I don’t have writing skills to share exactly my feelings/pain) then please go through my following experience/feedback to know why I said Don’t buy it.Don’t wanna give single star but not allowing this site to post without starReason to Buy: Trust AmazonBy looking at the 4.3 out of 5 rating and #1 Best Seller tag I got interest on this TV. As we have trust on Amazon and also as it was coming in my budget with good features I purchased this MI 4A PRO TV.But, seems majority of good review/ratings are paid ones. These are cheating us, off course they didn’t force to buy, but being middle class person/human being we may get attract to things which showing better in less price. Seems this made/gave opportunity to these sellers to cheat us.Amazon Delivery Feedback: I may not comment on all deliveries happening not safely but when it came to me it’s not delivered safely.This TV came for home delivery in Troalley Auto without proper placement/safety, asked delivery person why alone kept it while coming due to up and downs of road it may fly right. He didn’t listen my words, simply said will take it back if any physical damage.He only open it and as outside nothing see damage, Delivery person said if any inner damage during installation time Technician came to know and will replace it and he forced me to tell OTP to accept me deliver and left.TV Installation Feedback: Did by Amazon Technician PersonInstead MI Technician, Amazon Technician came and installed this MI TV. I got it installed Stand mount as wall mount not freely providing.Technician somehow explained TV usage but thinking as not MI person not have full knowledge and exploring and telling each details.However, normal usage of TV, this amazon technician help is fine.TV Experience:First day: Having slight less picture quality and few showing pixels not as required for Eye safeness.After 3 or 4 days: Picture quality came better. Sound/Audio quality was good either on OTT/Youtbe or Setup box/DTHUp to 11 days: As we not used much and simply using it for watch DTH channels. Everything looks good.After 12 days: Amazon replacement time expired then started showing sound/Audio problem.TV sound coming very slow, When installed time/first 10 days, if we set up Volume 15 or 20 it was able give bigger sound, now though we increase volume 60 or 65 not giving the sound that we heard when it installed/setup (Played the same content which we listen in Youtube when after installation completed).Regarding this yesterday raised request, online service person asked me to update build version to latest, Now, it is PL.6036 but still have the same problem.2 or 3 days ago while watching suddenly TV got turned off, We did power off and on then it got switch on usually, also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked. But, not sure what problem, we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issues.Not sure, seems as I bought from this Amazon or MI service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problem.Online service person instead sending Technician to home for verifying problem. Told and did build version update with me to latest (Software update). Later, he said Volume limit got increased to 100 now, we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior. i.e. Before if 15/20 volume level gives big sound, then now 50/60 volume level the same sound. Asked, when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of Volume limit increase. But, he told OTT/some apps will show difference of this new feature, at the time as I have been on this calls and worries, got tired, I said will see and get back to you with new request.After some time, when I visited my friends/ better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem, simply said some words to convey/tired us.Off course,  I can hear sound at 60 or 70 Volume but my concern is after purchase/installation of 13 days only I got this problem, in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruise.Being middle class person, we give value to single rupee also because we know how much efforts we put on to get that money. After purchase of this MI product crying lot why we went to it instead we could have went for further good brand product though they high in cost.Now, not replaced my TV or not did service by Technician. We decided that we got cheated on and prayed God to take care……,Bought two years ago. My panel stopped displaying just one week before the warranty was to expire after two years. They promptly replaced it with a new one. I did not even spend one rupee extra.  Hassle-free. Highly recommend buying Mi products. The product is also awesome.,Good,Best product Two negative things I should mention here: 1) The cable is too rigid, so there is movement on the USB connector point when inserting or removing device from the other end of the cable.2) The USB connector is a little loose, it must be tightly seated.Other features are alright.,This is the fourth time I order cable Earlier cable was good but now seems to compromise on quality not happy.,Worth its value,Good,Very good product and value for money. Satisfied with the performance.,wont cure cancer its simple cable nothing much to expect,Very good product,-too long-durable-good retro device Best but slow response from tv,Product is good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Knz9n24GL._SY88.jpg,Value for money,Super quality....go with TCL,,Best price,చాలా బాగుంది కానీ యుాస్ బి పోర్ట్స్ లోపల కాకుండా బయటికి ఇస్తే బాగుంటుంది మరియు గుాగుల్ క్రోమ్ ఇన్ బుల్ట్ గా ఇస్తే బాగుంటుంది Quick delivery.Awesome ProductPacking was goodJust opened the productExcited to you it Update after 9 months of use:1. The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It\\'s as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates, the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube, Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that\\'s an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However, after using it for 2 months, the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now, up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes, I set brightness to 0, and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,a. it often gets disconnected from wifi - have to restart it againb. prime video fails to resume - displays error - and have to restart the TV againc. On the home screen, you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first. You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first - easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself.,Only Cons till now got, fast moving object looks blurr, which was known before buying by other user review, but i got this tv in 32 k,Ao over all satishfied,Only minus that too critical is the installation service provider.The product is to installed by v care installation services provider.The installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properly.Actual date of installation was on 21.02.22 but was only done by the service provider on 27.10.22.The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and don\\'t know how to behave to the customer.He behaved very rudely.The installation service provider is a total damage and waste. Not at all worth.,,Awesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tv.,Dolby atom 4 k video etc,Good,Good ,What\\'s not to love about this all-new 55 inch Amazon Fire TV?UNBOXINGThe whole experience from delivery to commissioning was completely seamless;  the packaging is strong and very sturdy, using a lot of bio-degradable materials; the unboxing was a delight, and fixing the (included) wall mount was a piece of cake.AMAZON INTEGRATIONNow comes the Amazon Magic!  Switch on the TV, and it already knew me, and my Amazon Prime Account.  After a brief online security check, all my content and apps automatically appeared on-screen, and setup was done!OPTICAL AUDIO OUTI\\'m using a JBL soundbar with sub-woofer which are connected to my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV using an optical cable (not supplied), and by simply changing settings on the TV my audio system automatically switches on and off with the TV, and the supplied TV Remote has volume controls for my cinema sound.  The sound reproduction is First Class.  I can\\'t comment on the built-in TV Speakers, because I haven\\'t used them.PICTURE QUALITYThere are lots of presets for the screen, including Natural, Cinema, Gaming, etc., and you can also set a customised screen to your own liking.  The picture quality is excellent, every bit as good as my other TV from a famous brand that costs 4X the price of my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV.  I\\'m impressed!HDMI & CONNECTIVITYI\\'m only using HDMI1 because all my content is streamed and I have been using an Amazon Firestick, and Google Chromecast.  The Chromecast is plugged into HDMI1, and the TV automatically switches to it when you want to use it.  However, I don\\'t think I\\'ll be using the Chromecast much, because Fire TV is so good, and has an amazing remote control.I\\'m also using a 2TB External hard drive plugged into the fast USB.  Playing movies, even in HD, is a perfect experience with no lag or juddering.Access to the sockets on the wall-mounted TV is OK if you have small arms, and although I\\'m only using HDMI1, Optical Audio Out and one USB, there is plenty of connectivity for other equipment.JUST ONE THING...This version of FireTV only allows Alexa to speak 2 languages, viz. English (Indian), or Hindi.My Amazon Firestick, Echo Show 8, Echo Show 5, Echo, and Echo Dot all have settings for English UK, Aus, USA, etc, Spanish, French, German, and many other languages.  I really would like to use Alexa on my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV in my native language - it makes it easier for Alexa to understand me, and easier for me to understand Alexa.I hope that this will come in a software update.CONCLUSIONI think that this 55 inch Amazon Fire TV is amazing, and I would recommend it without hesitation.

It is also a value for money product. Highly recommended,Good small cable. Yet to be tested though.,Good one,This is good and long cable easy to use Working fine with Airtel DTH but the quality is cheap, it\\'s not strong,Earlier airtel tv remotes had larger keys which were easy to navigate. Wish airtel could make that happen.,ನೀವು ಕಳಿಸಿರುವ ವಸ್ತು ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ಕೆಲಸ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿಲ ಈಗಾಗಲೇ ನಾವು ಒಂದು ಬಾರಿ ವಾಪಸಾತಿ ಮಾಡಿ ದರೂ ಕೂಡಾ ನೀವು ಕಳುಹಿಸಿದ ವಸ್ತು ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ಕೆಲಸ ಮಾಡುತ್ತಿಲ ಆದ ಕಾರಣ ನನ್ನ ಹಣ ವಾಪಸ ಮಾಡಬೇಕಾಗಿ ವಿನಂತಿ,Good,Good,Works perfectly with the Airtel HD Set up box (not suitable for Airtel Xtream). Would generally be apprehensive before buying a remote online but this worked perfectly.,Genuine product.Lasts long time and it depends how u handle it.Frequent dropping leads to shorter life as it is a breakable product.Worth buying.,On Off button doesn’t work.

All in all its a good tv to buy.I am only disappointed about is that i had ordered tv with 8gb internal memory but i got was 4gb. I really dont understand the logic behind it.,Good for low budget peopels,, Works perfect for connecting my Dslr to ipad & tethering. Seems like a durable cable.,Good,WORTH FOR MONEY, EASY TO USE,Nice easy to carry,Supar,Product is nyc.. Price is bit high,Good,Okayish I liked it, worth the money, light weight and comfortable at every situation.this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn\\'t fit them,don\\'t worry.Even i thought it wouldn\\'t fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,,In this watch, the screen does not turn on and off on double tap, for that you have to press the button and the battery also takes more than 1 hour instead of 35 minutes to get fully charged.  And the battery also lasts only 3-4 days, just hope that in the future, if I update the software, then the double tap option will come.,Watch is user friendly, UI is great.Calling feature is great.This watch is different from others in music playing in watch speaker.Great experience.Watchfaces option is good.We can add watchfaces as we can.In my other watch this feature is missing.Love this watch.,This Smartwatch is perfect for beginners who\\'s buy first time smartwatch. ninja call pro plus is recently launched so it comes with latest features and specifications.

Calling experience is also very nice, speaker and microphone is quite decent sufficient voice at indoor. But battery should be better it has require charge 1 time in day. 3D curved display give awasome visual experience. Strap quality is very soft and female also use it very smoothly. So overall it has best smartwatch under 2K Display, Calling, Sensors, Bulit quality, Battery Back-up, sports Mods, Waterproof, etc. You should definitely go for this one. Satisfied Product.👍🔥👍,This watch is very good but 1 problem im using this watch from 1 week and a few days back its pixels were droping, the screen was not working properly but after restarting, it was working properly and from then i didn,t face that problem again.,Nice watch with good UI interface with calling feature. Power packed with features in very low price. If you are on tight budget and looking for caling smartwatch you should definitely go for this one.,The build quality is great.The review about this watches are as follows:Good call quality and Google assistant supportThe UI experience is very smooth except the split screen feature it\\'s a little bit laggyThe only thing that is only bad about this product is the step accuracy I feel like its a little bit lagging back but it catches up to it after a half an hourYou can buy this product if you are on a tight budget and want calling and good UI experience you can buy this product 2 months review- its been working fine, there\\'s been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn\\'t basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it could\\'ve been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, I\\'ll give it 9/10, it\\'s good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven\\'t understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i can\\'t check prove if that\\'s correct.the water resistance, I haven\\'t used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch 😗,I\\'ve used this product for 4 days, and i\\'m going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -So, Bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don\\'t get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you can\\'t silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it\\'s almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you\\'ve a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It\\'s a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super 👍. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn\\'t have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn\\'t an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that\\'s what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It\\'s good value for money smart watch.Light weight. Touch is smooth.All the features are 90-95% accurate.,a good product in this price range must buy itGOOD LOOKINGGOOD QUALITY,Good product is mst h,Average for calling good looking,I\\'m really happy to purchase this watch! It\\'s very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well! Overall, if you\\'re looking so good brand & good features, go for this ..,Product does not turn onPlease return the item. Please. I haven’t used any other battery pack so will not be able to provide the exact expected performance. Simply put it is not 20,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah,Happy with the product,👍,But it’s very heavy,Day by day battery life is reducing. Remaining parameters are good.,Slim & easy to carry for Travelling & very good looking, I\\'m very satisfied with this product overall Good, But it takes 4 to 5 hours to charge.,Very heavy. Must be about 1-1.5kg.Very quick charge. Takes ages (almost 8-10hrs) to fully charge. Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others. It is a reliable and high-quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity. I have been using this phone for two months. According to the price range, the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good. According to this range, the camera is also fine. If we look at the performance, then it is not useless at all, but it is okay. I did not face any problem in calling. The phone starts lagging a lot while browsing or using shopping apps. If I give my opinion then this phone is good for parents.... If you want to buy this phone, then you should compare it with Poco C31, for now there is not much difference in the price.,All is well but sim slot 🎰 damage,It is a very good phone on this price range. Good to use in day today life use.,Hi,A good budget phone,I bought this for office use. Has good battery life. And basic features of android work fine. However, I noticed later that this is actually Android 12 Go Edition. I don\\'t mind using it. But some features are missing (which most people might not use).  Better than Nokia c01 which has Android 11 Go Edition, and on website there is not mention of any update. So, on a budget of 6k you can definitely but this one.,Nice features, budget phone.,I like this product 😍 Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 (and even for early 2023)There are 2 reviews in this section. Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month\\'s usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile.

Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn\\'t distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly.

The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it\\'s a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it\\'s a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn\\'t makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.👍,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don\\'t buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it\\'s working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it\\'s ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.

Could have been made little bit cheaper cost wise.,All good,Fast and smooth,Ab mujhe computer ki jarurat nahi padti,Speed is fast but not as advertise I get around read speed 70MB/s and write speed 30MB/s,Good one,Product is ok. Touch screen functions well .step counting is not that much accurate, heart beat sensor is quite accurate but i think spo2 and stress measurement are not that much accurate,The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there\\'s not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.The watch is not very intuitive to use. It\\'s usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.Sleep tracking is decent.Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is goodAlso, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?,What i need in watch is not available so don\\'t need this...can get it in normal watch from other brands,Look and feel is awesome. This is great product suggestions from Amazon. Thanks,I like the step count and heart rate accuracy.

Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would\\'ve been much better, if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms, stopwatch & timer.Overall, it\\'s a good replacement of smartphone for me till now.,Action button(center button) is not good, it takes more than 1 attempt sometimes to perform OK action.,Battery backup bad,Needs to improve ringtone sound,best phone hai. nokia is always best. price thodi kam karni chahiye.,I like this product This was indeed an ideal purchase.

Looks nice and very compact,Powerbank is a must have mobile accessory i was looking for one which is small and safe most of them are either too bulk or not so good with mobile safety. This one serves my purpose though it\\'s not too light but compared to most it is lighter.It\\'s mostly in my laptop bag which has that option for access of USB port from outside for on the go charging. I have not tested it properly but easily charges my mobile twice with fullcharge it also has type c port but couldn\\'t test it.

As per my experience i feel it gives around 8000mAh.,It is worth to have this. Light weight, easy to carry, charging capacity, etc all good about this powerbank. I haven’t used any other battery pack so will not be able to provide the exact expected performance. Simply put it is not 20,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah,Happy with the product,👍,But it’s very heavy,Day by day battery life is reducing. Remaining parameters are good.,Slim & easy to carry for Travelling & very good looking, I\\'m very satisfied with this product overall Good, But it takes 4 to 5 hours to charge.,Very heavy. Must be about 1-1.5kg.Very quick charge. Takes ages (almost 8-10hrs) to fully charge. Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others. It is a reliable and high-quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity. Good quality. Does not make sound. A bit less stronger for heavier mobiles.,It\\'s having good adhesion and suction power. During my last few months of usage, i remounted this once due to broken windshield for different reason. adhesive was good even after remounting.  during my 3 months of usage once it came out on its own and I remounted its. usually, I park my car in both direct sunlight as well as in closed parking area. I am not sure it came out due to hot glass. But never faced that again. Also, mostly I use this mount with arms extended to it maximum length. arms are stable during the vibration of car due to bad roads. But one small con i felt is arms in full legth is bit shacking, but its stable if i try to move it. It could have been better. But that\\'s not problem for me as longs as it serves the purpose,Good product, value for money.,good one. Worth for money,Have been using for almost 2 months, not sure on the durability although this looks of good build - going good for now. It is sturdy and does the good job, I believe 350 is worth the money,Ok,Thanks to all for wirting a review which helped me buy this product, absolutely perfect, suction is good, quality and overall product looks perfect.,Good product in this price.

I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them – or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes – but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement – which is entirely non-negotiable – is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf – primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‘immersive listening experience’ and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers – because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone – but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung’s best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros\\xa0Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading\\xa0 of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a\\xa0screen recorder,\\xa0video call effects, Game Launcher,\\xa0Link to Windows,\\xa0Dual Messenger,\\xa0Quick Share,\\xa0Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others.

I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don\\'t perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I\\'m using right now in this phone, but I\\'ll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It\\'s a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use.

Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it\\'s a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good I liked it, worth the money, light weight and comfortable at every situation.this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn\\'t fit them,don\\'t worry.Even i thought it wouldn\\'t fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,,In this watch, the screen does not turn on and off on double tap, for that you have to press the button and the battery also takes more than 1 hour instead of 35 minutes to get fully charged.  And the battery also lasts only 3-4 days, just hope that in the future, if I update the software, then the double tap option will come.,Watch is user friendly, UI is great.Calling feature is great.This watch is different from others in music playing in watch speaker.Great experience.Watchfaces option is good.We can add watchfaces as we can.In my other watch this feature is missing.Love this watch.,This Smartwatch is perfect for beginners who\\'s buy first time smartwatch. ninja call pro plus is recently launched so it comes with latest features and specifications. Display Is top Notched and and brightness is enough for use at outdoor. Heart measure and Spo2 is well accurate all sensors are efficiently worked. Reading of data is accurate near 90 to 95% you can trust on it at emergency situations. It comes with 100 sports mods all types of activities and sports are coverd. Calling experience is also very nice, speaker and microphone is quite decent sufficient voice at indoor. But battery should be better it has require charge 1 time in day. 3D curved display give awasome visual experience. Strap quality is very soft and female also use it very smoothly. So overall it has best smartwatch under 2K Display, Calling, Sensors, Bulit quality, Battery Back-up, sports Mods, Waterproof, etc. You should definitely go for this one.

If you are on tight budget and looking for caling smartwatch you should definitely go for this one.,The build quality is great.The review about this watches are as follows:Good call quality and Google assistant supportThe UI experience is very smooth except the split screen feature it\\'s a little bit laggyThe only thing that is only bad about this product is the step accuracy I feel like its a little bit lagging back but it catches up to it after a half an hourYou can buy this product if you are on a tight budget and want calling and good UI experience you can buy this product Received the product today. The packing was intact though I found watch not at its proper place. It fell down inside the box and found the inner holding box damaged also. Not expecting any kind of tampering but thought to share the product packaging. Overall nice product, will share detailed review once use it for atleast a week.,Good watch through fire 🔥 boultI am impressed for this watch is so computableand all features are properly working like mean feature voice calling are properly working andThis price range are no any brand are give this feature I am Happy for this watchThank you Fire 🔥 boult,Pros: The phone supports both phone and apps calling. Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It\\'s good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it\\'s better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it\\'s close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it\\'s a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged. One feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch, there are lots of scratches within one month of usage.,All is good. Satisfied. Auto selection of sport mode is not there. You have to select each sport mode for each workout I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them – or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes – but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement – which is entirely non-negotiable – is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf – primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‘immersive listening experience’ and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers – because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone – but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung’s best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros\\xa0Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading\\xa0 of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a\\xa0screen recorder,\\xa0video call effects, Game Launcher,\\xa0Link to Windows,\\xa0Dual Messenger,\\xa0Quick Share,\\xa0Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others.

Till now i didnt feel anything bad in this mobile .Happy with the Purchase. Camera quality is Good. It works smoothly in all the options.,This is good performance handset but the quality of the camera is not good, even though they said it\\'s a 50 MP camera it\\'s doesn\\'t take that sharp picture. So you\\'re not thinking about camera it\\'s a good choice for this much amount. It\\'s also have a problem with 5g(jio) connectivity.,Touch not good,Na,Good phone but camera quality is not good enough but proccessor are great,Very nice,Budget Mein sabse mast phone,Camera quality is not up to the expectations I liked it, worth the money, light weight and comfortable at every situation.this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn\\'t fit them,don\\'t worry.Even i thought it wouldn\\'t fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,,In this watch, the screen does not turn on and off on double tap, for that you have to press the button and the battery also takes more than 1 hour instead of 35 minutes to get fully charged.  And the battery also lasts only 3-4 days, just hope that in the future, if I update the software, then the double tap option will come.,Watch is user friendly, UI is great.Calling feature is great.This watch is different from others in music playing in watch speaker.Great experience.Watchfaces option is good.We can add watchfaces as we can.In my other watch this feature is missing.Love this watch.,This Smartwatch is perfect for beginners who\\'s buy first time smartwatch. ninja call pro plus is recently launched so it comes with latest features and specifications.

This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don\\'t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won\\'t run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given.

It works well for that purpose. The fitting is perfect and no connection issues.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71JnAsJtMUL._SY88.jpg,Good product.,Working fine Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it\\'s a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn\\'t look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don\\'t find it good enough if I compare it with Boat\\'s App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band. 1. Please add app gallery when we do right to left swap on home screen. Because right to left swap or left to right swap have same pages.2. It should ring instead of vibrate in alarm or you can give it optional depends  on user.3. The temperature doesn\\'t sync fast I have to go in the noisefit app  again and again and do it on and off in weather settings to sync feels like jugad. All these things can be fix from updates so pls try to do it,The watch looks cool and works very well but the sensors are not the most accurate. It shows that I am up 1 to 1½ hour every night when I am not also the heart rate is generally higher than what it actually is and the calories burnt are lower, the pedometer is more or less accurate,Nice one. Only Bp monitor is missing.,I like this product,I liked the watch very much,I m happy,Good features,Good I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it\\'s still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn\\'t ever thought that this cable will be so long it\\'s good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter\\'s old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can\\'t blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place. I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it\\'s build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,Good one under This price..!

After using the phone for a day, I feel corners have been cut in various areas:JN1 sensor is not that great in low light. Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens. Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsung\\'s new F23.Thermal management is very poor. Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high. Same is the case when camera app is opened/simple games on flipkart gamezone are played. There are reports on youtube of narzo50\\'s camera shutting down on hot days.Above scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazy.Speaker and earpiece do not have crispiness (upper treble), instead sound like white noise. Earpiece volume is low. So is the speaker volume when on call. On the other hand, speaker volume is decent while playing back videos.Flashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones. I don\\'t really know if company did cost cutting here, or its a software bug.No fm radio and secondary mic.Minor features I missed if shifting from miui to realmeui - e.g. the gallery app is not as good as miui one, requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folder.Mediocre ram management with realmeui 2, android 11.To be fair, I could not find any major bug in realmeui 2.0 so far. The lcd display is fantastic, and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point, as opposed to yellowish 5500-6500k super amoled. There was no green or purple tint. Touch response was excellent. Screen protector, case, fast charger, usb c cable were present. The phone feels much slimmer than my bulky F22 due to its thin body, 10gm less weight and sleek case. Camera app has full fledged manual mode, something absent from Samsung\\'s F22.Disclaimer: Above impression has been made after using 4 smartphones over last 8 years: Asus Zenfone 5, Redmi 4, Redmi 7A, Samsung F22.Strongly consider other current alternatives too, like Redmi note 11, Poco m4 pro, Poco m4 pro 5g, Redmi note 10t 5g,  Samsung F22, Samsung F23, Moto G42 before buying Narzo 50.More info: Do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone. Check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking \\'I agree\\'. Turn off content recommendation by going to the Settings -> Additional Settings -> Get Recommendations and switch the green toggle off. To remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way, follow excellent guide by youtuber \\'tech office\\' mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands. I was able to uninstall hot apps/games this way.UPDATE:Detailed camera comparison between Samsung F22 and Narzo 50:Samsung\\'s HDR algo seems more sophisticated, narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much, there is also some oversharpening.Both cameras choose cool auto white balance, which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in \\'golden hours\\'. However, narzos colors become more \\'hue accurate\\' after choosing 6000-6500k white point in \\'expert mode\\', whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance. Narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in \\'expert mode\\', but samsung fully turns it off in \\'pro mode\\', resulting unusable photos.However, when using night mode, narzo\\'s photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night.  Gcam 8.5 for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows, much worse than realme\\'s night mode. On the other hand, thereas no gcam and no camera2api support for F22. At night, you can take long exposure shots (upto 8/16/32secs) through \\'expert mode\\' by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo, something you can\\'t do in F22. This however requires tripod support and whenever done properly, the results are very good.You have manual \\'film\\' mode in narzo, whereas you can\\'t even manually set white balance in F22\\'s video mode, as samsung\\'s lower end galaxys don\\'t have \\'pro video\\' mode.,This mobile is suitable for every oneIt\\'s goodBut camara is average,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719puSga96L._SY88.jpg,Good quality,Very good phone .Iam very happy with this while using.thank you Amaon.,I had purchased this phone in 10k and this phone is actually brilliant in this price range, Camera is good, fingerprint sensor is good, back panel is good (i purchased black one) , no hang but there is a small problem that battery drains little faster and when you click Home button, google assistant appears most of the time which is quite annoying sometimes, overall i am happy with the phone .,I wanted an affordable phone ; this fits the bill perfectly.,Fantastic finger reader, battery sustainability for a long time usage, and HD Quality natural photographs. Awesome product at stunning a price. I bought this product with the hope that it would be a good and stable selfie stick. But it didn’t help at all. .It is not suitable for large phones like IPhone 11 Pro Max . . Very clumsy and the tripod doesn’t stand at all. . Keeps sliding. .Had a very difficult time to set up the selfie stick. .,Pros :1. Useful stick - stable only till half length, after that it shakes like crap2. Bluetooth Remote is given which is very very useful (infact necessary i would say)Cons :1.Useful only till half opened - after that it shakes like anything.2.Lacks a mount to mount any led flashlight for low light videos.3. BIGGEST CON : cost of 2 batteries is more than the selfie stick itself. Now as i have no money for going for a gimble , so i am using this as well as bought 2 spare batteries (costed me 500 rupees for 2 batteries). Although i must say that you can find the CR1632 - 3v battery (the one used in this one) - much cheaper than what i paid on either local ecom website or local shops.,one must have this tripod to get full family picturethe quality is upto the markand it is standing strongly with weight of phonebluetooth control is quick and clear,If you are taking photos with your family at home then it is good. But if you are a single rider and ride solo then its length is normal. You will get only half of your photo. It should be of such length that the rider can take a complete picture with his riding gears.Then it is good for the riders. My suggestion is that it should be more length.,Everything is perfect except if you pull the tripod to a long hight,Superb,Good at all.,I haven\\'t used it much, product is good. Its neat and clean, remote works well. the part where phone keeps thats too hard to open and it needs to be more sturdy. 2 months review- its been working fine, there\\'s been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn\\'t basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it could\\'ve been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, I\\'ll give it 9/10, it\\'s good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven\\'t understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i can\\'t check prove if that\\'s correct.the water resistance, I haven\\'t used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch 😗,I\\'ve used this product for 4 days, and i\\'m going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -So, Bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don\\'t get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you can\\'t silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it\\'s almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you\\'ve a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It\\'s a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super 👍. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look I like it,Great phone in smaller amount these camera amazing and display very smoothly play,Mobile is good.. but Amazon very low service very product..,Value for money,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BpP86A3rL._SY88.jpg,Good product very nice,Sometimes fingerprint sensor is not working properly, camera quality is good, battery life is best ... overall it is a good product.. review added after 1month of use,Best phone in this range except battery life. I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones. My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don\\'t regret. I\\'ve used redmi phones before so I\\'m aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I\\'ve ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here\\'s my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it\\'s sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it\\'s not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could\\'ve been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren\\'t vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn\\'t as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you\\'re watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you\\'re looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models Not charge like original my brother have same charger which is comes with note 10 box his charger charge without heating and fast and this is not charging as original,Got great discount nice product,Please be aware while buying the original samsung 25w charger. There are many sellers on this link that sell a fake one.Pls check and buy from apparition retail for best product.Pls see the pic, on the right is the same product from another seller for 100/- lesser. The package was damaged and open. The charger only charges as \"fast charging\" and not super fast charging. The print on the adapter should be in gold font (original).The packing text etc is almost exact.. pls be careful as this can damage the mobile.The final one from Appario was original. Does Super fast charge as directed. Good charger and reliable...,Good,It works fine. The solidness is worth it. Me satisfied,Fast charging, as mentioned.,I am happy with the purchase. Please note that this charger head doesn\\'t come with the cable. Cable needs to be purchased separately. I already had a compatible cable so I purchased just the charger head.,Value for money Despite being affordable, these headphones are pretty good. I use them mostly for talking on the phone. The sound quality is crisp and clear, though for serious music listening, I think, other more expensive headphones will be better.,Worth to buy ..sound is also good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EzNRJ0DWL._SY88.jpg,The delivery was so fast the headphones are awesome 👌,Sound quality is goodCalling is also niceBut i like most of this earphone, it\\'s softness 👌,,Thanks to realme and AmazoneIt was good and delivered at the time,Highly recommended Battery life is low,Worth purchase,Good performance at this price range,A economical product to buy for average usage of checking time, heart monitoring, steps track, etc.Battery backup great single charge stands for min 3 days.Recommended only for simple use and show off.,First of all, this watch is budget friendly.watch faces - the app has a large number of watch faces step track - not that accurate but that fine• weather forecast:- 100% accuratesleep - pretty accurate information Overall, the experience is pretty good.But but but, The battery life is not that good only 4 days of battery backup.,Nice product,Good nice,Overall good product to buy [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn\\'t have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn\\'t an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that\\'s what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It\\'s good value for money smart watch.Light weight. Touch is smooth.All the features are 90-95% accurate.,a good product in this price range must buy itGOOD LOOKINGGOOD QUALITY,Good product is mst h,Average for calling good looking,I\\'m really happy to purchase this watch! It\\'s very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well! Overall, if you\\'re looking so good brand & good features, go for this ..,Product does not turn onPlease return the item. Please. Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product Bought this instead of original apple, does the work for 150rs, not as fast as apple charger but its a good option if you want cheap and good product, bought it for iPad pro 10.5 and it\\'s working flawlessly, build quality is ok, its not like i am gonna hang my clothes on it and i want a very strong cable, even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don\\'t buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it\\'s stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It’s good. Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money I ordered this phone based on specs it was providing, later I saw flood of negative reviews coming up on Amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned, if it was true.1. Calls getting disconnected - I had call with my brother last night and we talked for 50 min and call did not disconnect in the middle.2. Heating issue - While in day to day use never faced heating issue but It gets a little hot while charging, I can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable. Every phone with fast charging heats a little.3. Camera Quality - It has a decent 64 mp Samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes. You can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good. Attached pic of cake which I clicked indoor only bright light source was candle. It performed well I can say.(To people who complaint about camera -  I just cannot expect picture clarity of Apple or Samsung high end devices, i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid)4. AnTuTu Benchmark Score - While company claim of 740000+ while I tested i got a score of 700000+ . I again cannot complaint here because I don\\'t know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing. 700000+ is pretty decent score I can say5. Phone lag - In two days of testing it has not lagged at all. With multiple background apps running.6. Battery Drain - Revisit few of the settings on your device, like animation, transition effect etc to get most out of your battery. If your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most. Again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company. While I started to write this review my cell phone was at 100%. Now it\\'s almost 25 min typing till now it\\'s now showing 99%, i have set my screen at full brightness, i fell its decent. Also tested charging speed 0 to 50 in 12.03 min.7. Build quality - It\\'s sturdy and decent plastic is used. I can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint (Card Discount + Exchange Benefit etc) . Still I would take out 1 star here.8. Black colour issue - Did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour. It\\'s AMOLED screen. Black is highlight of AMOLED. In case you were using IPS / FHD panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing. I have Samsung M51 as secondary device and i see black similar on both.9. BGMI - I played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag.10. Two year warranty - They calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only 1 year. I have personally wrote to Iqoo team and Amazon team seeking an answer, with screenshots waiting for answer.BTW majority of phone manufacturers provide 1 year warranty only, even iPhone. Here I would say fight for you justice and seek answer from Iqoo or Amazon Team.11. Video call lag - Did not face any, did multiple video calls yesterday with different people, did not get any complaint from them about my video lag. For all of them my video popped up instantaneous.Overall I would say I had a great buy and can recommend this device to others , for all the folks bombarding negative reviews, I would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied. In case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justice.Overall i give this device a 4 star as of now since I am yet to test this device long term like 3 months or 4 months.*Please excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any. Entire review was typed on my phone Iqoo Neo 6.,I have been using a budget phone realme 3 since 2019 (dynamic black, 3GB/64GB). It served me well, but it was time for an upgrade. I was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything I wanted within my budget. Did I get one? Let’s dig into it!THE GOOD# Price. After discounts, I got a phone with practically all the features I wanted.# IQOO is basically from Vivo, an internationally recognized brand. Hopefully, I don’t have to worry about software updates for at least 3 years. IQOO is already doing good as I have received 3 security updates so far for the Android 12 that came out of the box. I will keep an eye on the security updates and OS upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for Vivo/IQOO for my next phone.# Dual 5G SIM support, which is futuristic. With 4G, the call quality has been superb so far.# E4 AMOLED 120 Hz 1300 nits (peak) 1080x2400 pixels display with 6000000:1 contrast ratio, 360 Hz touch sampling rate and HDR10+ (Netflix HDR supported). A huge upgrade from my previous phone. The photos, OTT movies look too good. Easier to read contents like messages, emails or documents.# 64 MP main cam with OIS. OIS was a must-have feature for me since I could be taking a lot of low-light photos.# 4700 mAh battery with 80W FlashCharge Technology; 50% in 12 min, 100% in 32 min. Works as claimed. The battery life has been satisfactory.# SD 870 CPU. Not one of the flagship processors today, but highly capable, and fantastic at this price. Inclusion of 12 GB RAM has made this phone a buttery-smooth one for running apps (Android is quite a RAM dependent OS unlike iOS). Up to 4 GB of phone storage can be used for extended RAM. Currently, I have 100+ apps installed (mostly productivity apps, but no gaming apps). The cascade cooling system seems to be working.# 256 GB ROM with UFS 3.1. Since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microSDXC slot, and this phone is no exception, I did not want the 128 GB variant. A fast, large internal ROM is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps, files slower.# The in-display fingerprint reader works well.# The stereo speakers are reasonably good.# Infrared port (IR blaster). I have not tried using it as a remote, but a must try.# USB-C port with USB-C to USB-A data cable that connects to the phone charger. Some of us prefer a USB-C to USB-C data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices, but I can see why IQOO decided to provide a USB-C to USB-A. Most laptops still come with USB-A ports (even my recent hp 250 G8 laptop from the company I work for does have a USB-C port without power delivery, and two USB-A ports!). My powerbanks don’t have USB-C ports either.# Screenshots, lock screen virtual buttons. Must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttons.THE BAD# Google backup. A FAIL. Since I did not have a USB-C to USB-C cable, I had to choose the Wi-Fi data transfer option from my old phone to this one. Although I selected all the files, Google failed to transfer many files especially the PDFs. Dear Google, this is unacceptable.# Spam handling. My realme 3 lets me block any SMS I want, but this one does not. In my opinion, every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an SMS as needed. I have stopped using a 3rd party app like Truecaller, which has become a truly rogue app.# No 3.5 mm jack (a plus when you don\\'t have a bluetooth earphone, or don\\'t prefer one), but IQOO thankfully included a USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter in the box.# The absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing, but I do not mind as I barely drop my phone, and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector, and a transparent back cover. Really appreciated. The plastic body does not bother me; moreover, the dark nova color feels cool. YMMV.# In my realme 3 (and not in my realme C2, which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific OS versions), if I try turning off the daily wakeup alarm, it gives me options like “Turn off on…” (the next day for which the alarm is active), “Do not repeat any more”, or “Cancel”. This is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day (say, an upcoming leave or holiday) without turning it off for the following days! Unfortunately, this artificial intelligence is not available in my IQOO Neo 6 5G.Always buy a recently released model if you are going for an Android phone. This will make sure that you get software support for long enough time. Moreover, avoid buying the variant with lowest RAM/ROM. And, fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the time.I have used this phone for ~ 2 months and will update this review as I keep using it. Till date, I am quite satisfied with IQOO Neo 6 5G (I also liked the Funtouch OS), and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me. ,Wow!!! Just wow!!! How can a beautiful product like this exist at such an affordable price?! I mean I am simply amazed by this watch. Kya dikhti hai yaar aur kya waqt dikhati hai yaar. Yeh ghadi tik-tik toh nahin chalti but it has made my life tracking theek-theek for sure since the day it is with me. I love this watch. The accuracy, colour (black), weight, apperance, etc. are so so so amazing.Giving 4 stars because its mobile app sucks for real. Mobile connectivity has a lot to be improvised. It could have been upto the mark agar ghadi banane pe itna kharcha kar hi diya hai toh :(,Nice product and user friendly compare to other smart watch.,Nice watch,Noise is best...it\\'s very useful product,I like,After 6 months the charging is not working,Good productI hv used this product since 1 year The selfie stick is made up of cheap quality plastic.However the built structure of the selfie stick is stable and even the tripod stand will provide you ample support to make a video  time lapse or a portrait selfie.Recommended to all video bloggers who have just started their channels on YouTube or any other sites.Its worth a product with the money we are paying to purchase it.,Did take this product on a trip. It\\'s good but I was always afraid whether it\\'s going to fell from the stand. The holder is clumpsy, cannot hold it tighter. Need another person help to insert the phone in the stand or need to sit down and stretch the phone holder to insert the phone. Maybe not worth 399₹. Let me know if you have any other doubts,It is user friendly,Product is good and light weight.,Works well and Bluetooth connectivity is also good.,Nice product.Bluetooth option Is good,Stability is ok only, otherwise a decent product,Good product It\\'s a good deal to get the SD card in this price, but it was even less in Reliance digital. But as I needed in 1 day it\\'s fine to order.,Looking or fake product...,Storage is perfect,Package quality not good,Installation was easy.i got it for my tablet.i had a confusion bw this and SanDisk and finalised this one coz mine is s6lite.free spce shown as 119 gb..it\\'s been only two days.no problem faced.will update if any issues arise.,I have purchased this card 3 times. In first two times, they delivered fake sd card with the same samsung branding but thanks to Amazon for accepting return request. In third time I got this genuine Samsung Evo Plus SD Card 64gb. I purchased this card in Rs. 599. You can also get this at less price during offer season. The least price I have seen is Rs. 539.Performance is almost good as I expected.Write Speed is about 17 to 25 mbps and Reading speed is around 35 to 45 mbps. But I did not tested reading speed too much. May be you will get better reading speed. Adapter is also good quality and performing good.Thank You...🙂,Go for it ensure size,Best Good charging speed as expected but heat up faster like it charged speed.,Best adapter for iPhone and buy one thing it can’t take more power supply voltage in it, it may damage,Go for it,Value for money product,Value for money,Fast charging. Very good product in this price. I have iPhone 13. It’s take 1 and half hour for Full charge.,Charges pretty well.,Working perfectly, value for money I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don\\'t perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I\\'m using right now in this phone, but I\\'ll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It\\'s a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting.

The bass part was also good. I only found the noise cancellation was not what I expected. It could be much better.

Good built quality, lag free interface, big screen size and good screen resolution are some of the key features of this watch.,Very happy with the purchase.Great job done by the Fireboltt.The display,UI and features are so good,special mention:build quality,top notch.A little disappointed with the less watch faces,i believe more watch faces will be adding soon.,The look of the smartwatch is amazing and is pretty heavy too. The screen is smooth but in the 360° movement in one of the menu view there can be a problem.The straps are deattachable which is an another drawback.,Bright displayNo laggingGood speaker and micNo issues with connectivityBest under 3k,perfectly satisfied.Crystal clear screen.,Over all good product,Best watch under 3000/- It\\'s a good product.,Like,Very good item strong and useful USB cableValue for moneyThanks to amazon and producer,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51112ZRE-1L._SY88.jpg,Good,Sturdy but does not support 33w charging,Nice product and useful product,- This is good mobile stand. Sturdy with mobiles but not sure about tablets. Looks good on the desk but not very much attractive as per its design.Unless you are not concerned more about look of the stand and want it for your mobile then, this will be good for you.,Nice product,This is very useful product..nd easy to use ..so I like it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V3BAUrbiL._SY88.jpg,The stand is okay for the price. Doesn’t look very fine, in fact looks a bit old even when brand new. The band name is also not imprinted clearly. Looks cheap, but did it’s job okay. I got it for ₹89 in a deal.Sometimes the mic gets blocked and the phone has to be adjusted a little out of the stand. Overall worth the buy,Product Material - full PlasticQuality - 7 out of 10,Fantastic product,  affordable,  makes work more comfort  🙌 ....Really I\\'m using it since a month, no issues and complaints...It\\'s quality is not reduced with time....  I think everyone need to buy....For the 1st time I\\'m giving a review of a product... after some 100s of products I bought here.... think how much I\\'m satisfies with this cute little thing.....,The product is not the best but a better option at that price range. Bought it for just 119 rupees The earphones have good clear sound quality. It lacks base. Battery backup is good. ANC is a myth in this earphone. It might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,Eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. Over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,Bought this solely due to its form factor - to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. To be true Samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique TWS.This is not an inear style TWS but resembles somewhat earbud style TWS, only of its kind in the market as far as my Knowledge goes.They are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out (strange as I can\\'t use earbuds because they fall out frequently). It seems that Samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. However, it doesn\\'t mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.The finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch.  The size of the buds and the case is very small.Now about the sound. If the buds fit in one\\'s ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.The sound signature is very bassy for my taste and I have to eq it to my taste. The bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. I listen it in TREBLE BOOST mode adjusted through the app. ANC works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. In contrary, ANC ON somewhat opens up the sound. Don\\'t buy this for ANC.Strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iPhone 12mini than my Galaxy S22 (Spotify and Apple Music). The buds have app support for both Android (Galaxy wear) and iOS (Galaxy Buds Live) but the Android app is more feature packed and works better.  The iOS app couldn\\'t update the firmware (although there is a Menu in the app) and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. However,  as soon as I connected with my S22, on pairing,  the first thing it did was to update the firmware.I love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4K against an MRP of 16K. The do sound very good but does not suit my taste.  Persons loving bass may love them. Don\\'t get them for ANC. Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. It has wireless charging too. If your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,Best call quality. Noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.Descent battery life.Music is good. Not to that top notch, but good in this segment.Overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,I am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,Bluetooth range is not that good,The sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. I got these for Rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. It feels like I am using bluetooth v3.0. The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. The mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone\\'s quality. If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. Even at Rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. It is better to buy a wired IEM, atleast it will sound better than this.,In this price Samsung brand is goodEasy to wear and good battery backupHardly support the 2 meter Bluetooth connectivity Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 (and even for early 2023)There are 2 reviews in this section. Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month\\'s usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands\\' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are \"un-installable\". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the \"Alert slider\" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in \"Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn\\'t distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it\\'s a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it\\'s a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn\\'t makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.👍,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don\\'t buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it\\'s working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it\\'s ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good. Very nice product and easy to use as well as very soft to cable.,IN PICTURE SHOWS AS 16 NOS BUT IN COVER ONLY 8 NOS,Easy to attach with usb cable. Bought total 12 pieces in Rs99. Loved it ❤️,Quality product,So far ok. Will hold the wire connecting after the USB joints. But couldn\\'t stop it from bending,Don’t even think of buying this by just looking at the cheap price of this product as it has been made by cheap quality plastic which can not protect your cables as it is not at all sturdy so please don’t buy,Only two packs came,The product is cool. Value for money. Love it So about the product Boom ultima, as it goes by the name it really got the ultimate bass effect. Wires are great built and tangle free. The audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well. I just didn\\'t find the case. It was missing from my product. Though they have given 2 pairs of extra buds with different sizes. Overall it\\'s a great wired in mic earphones. Go ahead and add to your cart. You won\\'t regret it.,So first, let\\'s talk about the external-Bulid quality is awesome 9/10 even at such an affordable price.Looks-I have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWire-the wire quality is 9/10. I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven\\'t tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it\\'s difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. 😊As you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it\\'s time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that\\'s awesome. But don\\'t listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it\\'s 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won\\'t take more than 2 working days)It\\'s an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ☺️🙃Edited:-Their services are slower now. Don\\'t know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.It\\'s not a problem though cause you can mail \\'em regarding this. This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone.Still the best earphones, you can find at this price point,NOT FOR HIGH BASS LOVERS,Everything was OK but as shown in the picture that you will get a case along with earphones,which was not there inside it(only earphone and some earplucks were there),This range very good product.if your budget under- 400 definitely you can bye this product.,Nice product,Product is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also, despite the return of first delivery of the product  for REPLACEMENT with pouch,product is good but needs to work on noise cancellation I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue.

It is my first ever OnePlus phone. My personal review about this phone is as under:Pros:1. Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it\\'ll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons:1. If you use without case, it doesn\\'t feel like premium phone.2. I don\\'t like the sound quality although is has dual speaker. You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad.3. Selfie camera needs improvement.4. Zoom is very bad on rear camera.5. No IP certification.6. No expendable storage.7. Paid theme store.8. Should have some dot notch animations like samsung.  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons, if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs. 35000/- you can go for it.,Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously, i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand. Love to see metallic frames in coming phones. Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5.,This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use. But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh. Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment. Although it\\'s Oxygen os, it is not well optimised. From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps. Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor. The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model don\\'t go for this model because of the brand. One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update. Another bad thing its primary camera design. One of the three camera is so big that it\\'s embracing to say its price is 39k.,I would like to get directly to the pros and consPros.1) BATTERY - The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges. It\\'s just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now, I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore!2.  CAMERA- The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures. No complains.3. LOOKS - The phone looks really beautiful. I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium looking.CONS1) The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of. Having said that, the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent. It\\'s otherwise quite smooth2) The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed. I was used to it on my 6T3)Volume - Not too happy with the phone speakers. They somehow are not up to the mark.To sum it up- Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking, good performing phone. It packs too much for a 43k phone - good battery, fastest charging in the segment, premium looks, good performance.,Using the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI, tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre it\\'s common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10pro.So we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as well.Overall device working good so far I experienced average camera results,superb charging but not so extended battery life, touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks, hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phone.,Over all camera 📸 is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is it\\'s processer dimencity 8100max it\\'s a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also it\\'s runs very smoothly and it\\'s my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE I\\'m the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plus,Its speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them – or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes – but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement – which is entirely non-negotiable – is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf – primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‘immersive listening experience’ and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers – because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone – but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung’s best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros\\xa0Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading\\xa0 of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a\\xa0screen recorder,\\xa0video call effects, Game Launcher,\\xa0Link to Windows,\\xa0Dual Messenger,\\xa0Quick Share,\\xa0Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others.

Highly recommended for students !,One side is slightly tilted,Good product ....,Good grip & sturdy product. Fullfill the need. Overall very good product. Given gift to friends.,Good,Quality is good,Built quality good,Excellent product I am very happy after using it.  This power bank is very good.  I have seen a video on YouTube with an amazing rating before buying it.  Enjoyed buying it.,Good product value for money.,Esme ek choti torch Jaisi light add Karke thoda price Badha Den to Mast Raho 10,Over all a great product but i have faced a problem while charging the power bank with my mi 120w charger it never accept quick charge and sometimes takes more than 12 hours to charge.While with macbook pro charger it accepts quick charge (that green light).I bought a separate charger for this power bank😭,Good I like it,Power bank is good the only issue was the cable which came with it broke after a day of use and also damaged power port of phone,Just good as expected, compact size, came with a premium good packing.... need see how it performance. With 10000mah u can charge 2 devices at a time. But good for a single charge of 5000mah mobile.  They have given one USB A type to C type cable, if you have another C type cable, with that u can charge another device. I like the carrying pouch they provided.,I didnt got any pouch with this power bank Phone is ok except middle button it’s a headache.  rest all is good battery lyf is about 10-12 hrs when fully charged,Superb battery life for more then 3 days,I bought this phone to use as a replacement of my smartphone for calling, alarm, listening songs purposes.I didn\\'t face any problem but the sound & its quality is somewhat low compared to normal smartphones. Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would\\'ve been much better, if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms, stopwatch & timer.Overall, it\\'s a good replacement of smartphone for me till now.,Action button(center button) is not good, it takes more than 1 attempt sometimes to perform OK action.,Battery backup bad,Needs to improve ringtone sound,best phone hai. nokia is always best. price thodi kam karni chahiye.,I like this product Worth every penny compared to the cost. A basic Bluetooth band that support only single device at a time. Call voice us clear,  and microphone does a decent job of noise cancellation.Don\\'t expect good base treble in this. The rubber ear piece is not tight enough even with the large ones and keeps slipping away. The magnet is also weak and doesn\\'t connect smoothly,I had ordered my first ear phone from ptron only and to tell the truth, it is very difficult to get such a good quality earphone phone at such a low price.  Best earphones in such a low price. You will not regret the money you have spent if you buy this.,It is a good product,Y,Nice,Built quality is lil bit cheap, but sound quality is superp comparing to other grand companies like jbl, sony, Senheizer, bass is moderate, noise cancelling needs to be improved, my overall rating is 4star.,Good,Good quality It\\'s a good deal to get the SD card in this price, but it was even less in Reliance digital. But as I needed in 1 day it\\'s fine to order.,Looking or fake product...,Storage is perfect,Package quality not good,Installation was easy.i got it for my tablet.i had a confusion bw this and SanDisk and finalised this one coz mine is s6lite.free spce shown as 119 gb..it\\'s been only two days.no problem faced.will update if any issues arise.,I have purchased this card 3 times. In first two times, they delivered fake sd card with the same samsung branding but thanks to Amazon for accepting return request. In third time I got this genuine Samsung Evo Plus SD Card 64gb. I purchased this card in Rs. 599. You can also get this at less price during offer season. The least price I have seen is Rs. 539.Performance is almost good as I expected.Write Speed is about 17 to 25 mbps and Reading speed is around 35 to 45 mbps. But I did not tested reading speed too much. May be you will get better reading speed. Adapter is also good quality and performing good.Thank You...🙂,Go for it ensure size,Best I bought this power-bank to use during my vacation with family. It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side. Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,Bit heavy but does it’s job. Takes tooooooo much time to charge. Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,I needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity. So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try, as i already have Honor & MI power banks (10000mAh ones). Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones, iit did live up to my expectations for the 1k range.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••→ Powerbank→ MicroUSB cable→ Carry pouch (depends on which package you received, more below)→ User manual/Warranty card→ General leaflet→ Feedback leaflet••••••••••••••••••••••••📝 SOME DETAILS••••••••••••••••••••••••→ Mfg: October 2019→ Charging time: 9 Hrs 50 Min (via 10W charger, low battery indication to full charge)→ Backup: Was able to charge (5-100%) Redmi Note 5 pro\\'s 4000Mah battery ~3.5 times with regular usage in between.••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. High capacity power bank with dual input (micro USB or USB C).2. Dual output via 2 USB ports.3. Not a fast charge/quick charge device but has an output of 5V/2.4A (12W) which is good enough.4. Touch button for power checks or switch it on for charging device.5. It comes with a carry pouch. (more below on this part).6. Compact form factor & sturdy design with ABS body.•••••••••••••➖ CONS•••••••••••••1. It does not auto-start charging when the device is connected.2. Since it has a touch button instead of push-button, it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling.3. There is a lot of conversion loss & backup is slightly less for a 20000mAh power bank.▶ Cons are significant enough to reduce 1 star. There is scope for improvement (points 1 & 2) in this product in the same range.

When i first received this power bank it came in a small box (approx 12x9x3cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) with everything forced in congested space. The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal & no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away.→ This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch.2. When replacement came, it came in a poly-wrapped bigger box (22x10x4 cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging. The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. Looked like it was applied with an open box. So its presence was useless.→ This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch.••••••••••••••••••••••••👜 CARRY POUCH••••••••••••••••••••••••→ As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box.→ Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. (Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. Neither loose nor tight.→ Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon.••••••••••••••••🏆 VERDICT••••••••••••••••▶ At the price point its not a bad deal. Its a midway path b/w low quality and high-quality ones. You can very well go for Ambrane, as it makes good quality & durable power banks. Rest, nothing is perfect in this world. For this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1-year warranty from Ambrame is available.▶ If one can extend the budget by a few hundred, MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body & better quality overall. I have MI, Honor & Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be (from low to high) Ambrane → Honor → MI,I am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family. Before to this i have bought their PP-30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. My dad uses Redmi note 7, my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you don\\'t need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same- Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP-30- Solid and sturdy built- 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product-  ₹200 cheaper price than MI- Touch button at the top to know the power status (this is something unique)-  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13% to 100% at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro- I don\\'t know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 Amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself. I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dad\\'s Redmi note 7 (which supports QC 4.0) either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP-30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampCons:-- Very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box- It has some adhesive tape at the top i don\\'t know why ? which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same- No torch light, their PP-30 have it- only micro cable inside the box,Definitely heavy but I knew this. I will recommend this, as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phones.,Nice product,Power backup is good.. but the USB cable provided is very bad. It stopped working after few months of usage,Everything is good but the battery don’t last that long when use for charging two device. Build quality is good and it is comes with 2 year warranty.,Good Product,Bought it for charging my mobile & tab but it doesn\\'t work for Lenovo m8 tab,Guys this cable is is best compare of everyone over heat protection, quickly charging, but chance to shock circuit,good,Nice,Good quality,1.5एम का डाटा केबल मेरे लिए बहुत ही लाभदायक है ।  मैं इस केबल को लाइन में चार्ज करते समय फोन बहुत आराम से उपयोग  कर पा रहा हु । आप इस केबल से 15watt का  चार्जर उसे कर सकते है (इससे जड़ा नही) । लोकल बाजार में इसका दाम 150 है ,  अमेजन पे ये केबल मुझे 67 में मिला । गर्व से कहो हम हिंदू है , जय हिंद जय भारत , I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don\\'t perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I\\'m using right now in this phone, but I\\'ll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It\\'s a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use.

The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69\"), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did\\'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can\\'t figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does\\'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does\\'nt matter as most don\\'t want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,👍,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,It\\'s little expensive but okkk, [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn\\'t have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn\\'t an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that\\'s what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It\\'s good value for money smart watch.Light weight. Touch is smooth.All the features are 90-95% accurate.,a good product in this price range must buy itGOOD LOOKINGGOOD QUALITY,Good product is mst h,Average for calling good looking,I\\'m really happy to purchase this watch! It\\'s very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well! Overall, if you\\'re looking so good brand & good features, go for this ..,Product does not turn onPlease return the item. Please. Worth for money - suitable for Android auto... my purpose served in car....got it for Rs.150,Everything is Okay. But packaging is not good feeling like seller gave is used cable.,Good product,Good product but cost is more.,Original cable,I bought this cable at 129. Using this cable for Android auto in my car. Perfectly works without any glitch.,Original MI cable. Will charge upto 33 watts. Got it for Rs 150.  I have 67 watt charger and I want a cable for my car so I went for it. I checked the performance with battery charging app. The charging speed is exactly half of my 67 watt original cable. Go for it.,It provided me turbo charging. I recommend for all Redmi note 10s mobile phones. As it provide turbo charging. I am veri happy with this product. I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it\\'s still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn\\'t ever thought that this cable will be so long it\\'s good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter\\'s old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can\\'t blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place. Item is good.  No issues.  It supports mobile which have great charging inbuilt feature.,Charging is good but cable quality not good,Good,If your smartphone doesn\\'t support more than 20w fast charging then this will cover it for you I would suggest getting a different cable if you want something with more length but the standard cable it comes with is pretty solid, no cheap feeling whatsoever,Pretty good charger for any mobile device provided that the device supports 18 w fast charging and USB type c port..(Ofcourse it is 22.5 w)I would like to suggest this to all of them who are subjected to irreparable in box charger especially redmi note 8 pro users😬,very good  product,Bought this to charge my Mi A1 mobile.Even though the Mi A1 has a lower amps and voltage rating than this charger, upon research, I found that a mobile communicates with the charger and only requests the required amps and voltage from it.And this has proven to be right as my mobile is perfectly charging with this charger.,you wont find this good of a charger and cable combo for this price 649. I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don\\'t perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I\\'m using right now in this phone, but I\\'ll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It\\'s a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it\\'s a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good It is good for data cables...I liked it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QHClS+4gL._SY88.jpg,Nice,So basically its good product with good quality, but this product is overpriced because same product from different brand are selling at 25% or more less money, still i bought this because of the brand name.,Gud quality and packaging but slightly expensive.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61W2kONTcaL._SY88.jpg,Ok,Using this for my mobile charging cable it’s useful for not to brake the cable I was looking for a phone below 10K. I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don\\'t strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don\\'t need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don\\'t watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don\\'t need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don\\'t have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn\\'t heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don\\'t think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can\\'t especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don\\'t like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should\\'ve 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don\\'t know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... \"NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING\"NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it\\'s all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it\\'s battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it\\'s dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it\\'s amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don\\'t buy this for camera....just don\\'t. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don\\'t recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- camera😤😤,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera\\'s good, durability also seems to be good, I\\'ve dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it\\'s a little less for me. But I don\\'t have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don\\'t do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it\\'s working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine The cable is efficient in fast charging but in quick data transfer. Overall fine.,I like the usb c  L shape. Nylon Shielded core wire it improves the life of the cable.,i think i buy these every 6 months or so. fast charging stops working after a while. probbly something to do with the cable design. the cable gets twisted over time and I suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside. but i keep buying it because there arent too many options in an L shaped design,Good and durable product. Sometime the charges doesn\\'t work on few adapters. there might be few cut off or something but works fine on apple adapter, Car charger, USB,The product is really good at affordable price.,Good and fast charging, and value for money,பொருள் உடைய கடினத்தன்மையின் நன்றாக உள்ளது சார்ஜ் ஏறும் வேகம் 15wat,Not a fast charger.  Very slow charging with 65w.  L-shape pin is very useful. I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones. My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don\\'t regret. I\\'ve used redmi phones before so I\\'m aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I\\'ve ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here\\'s my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it\\'s sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it\\'s not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could\\'ve been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren\\'t vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn\\'t as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you\\'re watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch.

Till date it\\'s working well.,One slot got out of order and one using now.value of money and second slot of the charger is average to use.🤪🤪🤪😂😂🇮🇳,Good quality no issues till now working fine with 5v 2ampAs it is 10 watt charger.,Fast charging,Yes it\\'s very nice,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pgVx61I7L._SY88.jpg,Amazing product. Great charging power even two devices  connected with the charger. I charged my pixel 6a and wireless headphone together, both get charged quickly. But issue with the build quality. I once by mistake sat in the charger and the socket end of it broke from the edges and came out completely. I had to fix that with a fevi quick. Now working fine . Overall a very good product. Don\\'t think, just go for it.,It\\'s a good product for this price range. Works fine. Product is just as described and does what it has been described to do. Durability and other features may have to wait while we use the product more to state justifiedly,Helpful for charging multiple devices at a time.,Very good handy product,Build quality is really nice. Happy with packaging and timely delivery.,Nice one,This is a very good plan, it fits comfortably in any switch board and a red indicator lights up inside it,Good product,Good value for money.

Kudos to the team!,Overall a great product I had this fear before buying that how good it will adhere but it\\'s doing fantastic the only field where they had a scope of improvement is the plastic quality it\\'s decent but could have been better,Good,Except minor noise, rest all good,Stayed well overall through a rough drive of 1000km and seems sturdy enough to last long. However, the nuts at the joints needed tightening 3 -4 times during the trip and there are a few rattles too.,Quality product with affordable price.,I Used this for swift Dizre 2018 Model Working Good condition  and specially it has the lower hook. so it hold Good .Nice one . if you looking for buget segement just buy it .

Not too much low, clarity in the bass is some what Missing, light weight when compared to boat 225. Finally boat 242 is good at. Its price range.,Mic, sound quality crystal clear , bass is also good and the wiring quality is very good overall earphone is very good in this range. Worth hai product me,Bought them 2 months ago... No other complains so far.... Everything going great...But are little overpriced for 550,Nice,Bast Strong enough, good one to hold.,It\\'s serves the simple purpose of holding phone..But it\\'s not possible to make a phone sit in 90° ..phone slants back little.. (i use pen adjusted at back to keep phone in 90 angle).. worth for simple use,Best,Nice,Avarage,Sturdy product.,EFFECTIVE PRODUCT FOR THIS PRICE RANGE,Good 👍 If your budget is low and you are looking for a good phone then you can buy this realme narzo 50i,The product is very nice and good quality . after using so many days ithe product is not warm and also phone is not hang .so the is good at this price,Average preform,Good,Good,Ok for normal use, build quality and battery is good..,Battery life is ok maximum working 12hrs after 100% charge,Ok I haven’t used any other battery pack so will not be able to provide the exact expected performance. Simply put it is not 20,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah,Happy with the product,👍,But it’s very heavy,Day by day battery life is reducing. Remaining parameters are good.,Slim & easy to carry for Travelling & very good looking, I\\'m very satisfied with this product overall Good, But it takes 4 to 5 hours to charge.,Very heavy. Must be about 1-1.5kg.Very quick charge. Takes ages (almost 8-10hrs) to fully charge. Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others. It is a reliable and high-quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity. Phone is ok except middle button it’s a headache.  rest all is good battery lyf is about 10-12 hrs when fully charged,Superb battery life for more then 3 days,I bought this phone to use as a replacement of my smartphone for calling, alarm, listening songs purposes.I didn\\'t face any problem but the sound & its quality is somewhat low compared to normal smartphones. Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would\\'ve been much better, if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms, stopwatch & timer.Overall, it\\'s a good replacement of smartphone for me till now.,Action button(center button) is not good, it takes more than 1 attempt sometimes to perform OK action.,Battery backup bad,Needs to improve ringtone sound,best phone hai. nokia is always best. price thodi kam karni chahiye.,I like this product I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it\\'s build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,Good one under This price..! One of the Best Android phone by Vivo 💚,Its super good for normal usage,Camera is ok for normal,It\\'s working fine and no issuew. Iqoo providing quality devices compared to other brands,Camera quality is not that high,Value for money,Phone is very handy and battery is also good. Quality of phone is good. Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product I am very happy after using it.  This power bank is very good.  I have seen a video on YouTube with an amazing rating before buying it.  Enjoyed buying it.,Good product value for money.,Esme ek choti torch Jaisi light add Karke thoda price Badha Den to Mast Raho 10,Over all a great product but i have faced a problem while charging the power bank with my mi 120w charger it never accept quick charge and sometimes takes more than 12 hours to charge.While with macbook pro charger it accepts quick charge (that green light).I bought a separate charger for this power bank😭,Good I like it,Power bank is good the only issue was the cable which came with it broke after a day of use and also damaged power port of phone,Just good as expected, compact size, came with a premium good packing.... need see how it performance. With 10000mah u can charge 2 devices at a time. But good for a single charge of 5000mah mobile.  They have given one USB A type to C type cable, if you have another C type cable, with that u can charge another device. I like the carrying pouch they provided.,I didnt got any pouch with this power bank I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don\\'t perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I\\'m using right now in this phone, but I\\'ll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It\\'s a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it\\'s a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good I like it,Great phone in smaller amount these camera amazing and display very smoothly play,Mobile is good.. but Amazon very low service very product..,Value for money,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BpP86A3rL._SY88.jpg,Good product very nice,Sometimes fingerprint sensor is not working properly, camera quality is good, battery life is best ... overall it is a good product.. review added after 1month of use,Best phone in this range except battery life. I used my 13 pro without a screen guard for a year now this screen guard was easy to apply but is a bit slippery and when you do the long press (ex. when you long press on WhatsApp for reaction or other options it automatically takes random press) also a bit shiny when you use it near lights.,Very good product, value for money,I have tried many screen guards and many types for my iphone 13This one takes the cake- The application was a smooth process- The screen guard is so smooth for some reason compared to ones i have used before- I have use many screen guards that say they don’t dont catch fingerprint but always end up. But this is does not catch fingerprint at allIf u pay 500 INr higher u will get the spigen ones which protects the front sensors tooHappy with my purchase and moving forward will be applying spigen screen guards for all my products,This is hands down THE BEST screen protector for iPhones. I got the iPhone 13 one and it’s excellent. So easy to install, anybody can do it! It’s so smooth and soft to touch and fits perfectly on my iPhone. Highly recommended. Maybe bit pricey but you get 2 in the box. Fingerprint free and smudge free.,Very nice product to buy.This tempered glass is easy to install no need to worry about airbubbles while installing tempered glass.it is very easy to install on any mobiles as it designed for.worth for your money.,The quality and adhesion is good. Instalation was pretty easy.What i would have liked1. Had it had a black bezel so it blends well with the phone so that no one could make out that a protective tempered glass is stuck.2. Had it also covered the front camera like the ESR protective glass does, it would have been better.3. Would have appreciated a price around 500, definitely overpriced.,Super easy to install. The screen guard got attached without any hassles and was perfect fit. The EZ fit tray works like magic.,I used this product for my iPhone 13 Pro with a peak design phone case. The quality of the screen protector is excellent and the engineering concept used for the installation is the best I’ve ever seen. They even include useful tools and guidelines to minimise the possibility of error. Good fit, nice smart watch in this price range, especially for  those who need only basic features . I bought grey color,It\\'s been long I\\'m using this now. It has no issues. The battery, touch screen, bluetooth connection every thing works fine. I was looking for something simple and I got this.,Nice design and functionsCan\\'t connect to Whatsapp and other social media app 👎,The modes in the watch are good. The UI sucks. Responsiveness could have been better. Battery life is moderately upto 3-4 days if worn constantly. Colour of the band is a bit faded too.,Activity Record, sleep tracking is Good.,Good product,I bought it for my wife and she was very glad.,Good Phone is ok except middle button it’s a headache.  rest all is good battery lyf is about 10-12 hrs when fully charged,Superb battery life for more then 3 days,I bought this phone to use as a replacement of my smartphone for calling, alarm, listening songs purposes.I didn\\'t face any problem but the sound & its quality is somewhat low compared to normal smartphones. Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would\\'ve been much better, if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms, stopwatch & timer.Overall, it\\'s a good replacement of smartphone for me till now.,Action button(center button) is not good, it takes more than 1 attempt sometimes to perform OK action.,Battery backup bad,Needs to improve ringtone sound,best phone hai. nokia is always best. price thodi kam karni chahiye.,I like this product The camera is good, phone is quite respponsive, fast charging.There are some niggling software issues and do not forget password (pin), there is no way you will be able to get it back to factory settings,This is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please DO NOT update your device to the latest software version. Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it\\'s best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,Above average performanceNo heating issueFastest fingerprint reader&face unloakGood battery lifeOk camera qualityLight weight,comfortable on hand,All the features of this mobile was good.no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games.withinh the budget only it was available for me.,Dual tone flash light is not working i think it\\'s only single led light,Two things missing1. Pin hole camera2. Earphones jack.Overall 👍,Camera Excellent, but battery life not good, maximum 6 hours,As this price limit its a good mobile with camera, battery, screen quality Very fast charging,It\\'s a original item and does it\\'s job. Price can be low on other sites bye overall very good product with blink of the eyes service by Amazon,Fully fast charger,I really like the power of this charger. This charge my device so fast. Really value for money.,,Sachme Achcha Hai, Aap Kharid Sakte Hai.,It\\'s good at this price. Really doing fast. Valuable Product, I like this product,It\\'s okay for a backup emergency phone or a naive user who uses it just for other extra sim or basic needs,All are fine,Good,Finger print is good for this phone battery life is excellent and camera quality too.,best budget phone between 10-15k adapter pin is A type BATTERY LIFE IS OK 1 and half day,This is a good product at this price.The battery is really good. With 6gb ram octa-core processor and 128gb ram it\\'s a good phone. However it should not be compared with other similar products available at higher Price because those products use different processors for which the price goes up. The camera is just a decent one but not very good.It depends what are you looking for. If you want a good camera with better processor then you have to spend more. At such price it will replace redmi phones, because it does outshine redmi phones in all aspects.,Good This is My first 5G IQOO mobile  purchased on 26th December at Amazon. Till now i didnt feel anything bad in this mobile .Happy with the Purchase. Camera quality is Good. It works smoothly in all the options.,This is good performance handset but the quality of the camera is not good, even though they said it\\'s a 50 MP camera it\\'s doesn\\'t take that sharp picture. So you\\'re not thinking about camera it\\'s a good choice for this much amount. It\\'s also have a problem with 5g(jio) connectivity.,Touch not good,Na,Good phone but camera quality is not good enough but proccessor are great,Very nice,Budget Mein sabse mast phone,Camera quality is not up to the expectations Definitely isn’t as good as the original cord but works. Fast charging and pretty sturdy,Worth it,So I had a faulty cable. I was lazy and have a lot of money so instead of calling Apple I bought this for like 300 bucks. Didn’t expected much but for my surprise, this cable actually works and has fast charging. JUST GO FOR IT,Felt quite sturdy, the connectors look premium and were easy to insert. I used this cable to switch all my data from iphone 7 to an m30s. Cable worked like charm while using smart switch app, all my data including whatsapp data was transferred successfully. Satisfied with performance.,Just good,Quality is very goodWorking smoothly.. using same portronics pd charger,This is a real fast charging cable that is serving the purpose,Very good rating everything is okay except voice sound during call,Battery life is very good... sound is also loud..Economical.,charger quality bad,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614VMH+hRtL._SY88.jpg,Battery lasted for 15+ days with low-medium usage. All functionality works fine. Perfect for someone wanting to limit the distractions of a smartphone.,Good product for elders,Working well for about 1 year. Everything okay,There is some disturbance in the sound While using wireless FM Loosing charging cable of apple is costly affair. This wire was great purchase made to correct it,Worked well for six months that’s it, now it’s stopped working, now planning to buy one more because the price has come down to 150,Very good product. Compatible with  iPad 2nd generation  and charging very well. Quality of the product is very good and also works fine. Totally worth for its price.,Product is super,I\\'m using from last 6 month. Till now it was good functioning. Now I noticed phone gets disconnected at multiple occasions. might be cable may be damaged.Overall worked well for 6 month.,Takes 5-6 hours to charge full.,Good item. Value,It is the best product I have used till now. This was indeed an ideal purchase. Good performance, good built, up to the mark functionality at this price. Stable and Sturdy. Recommend. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,Looks ok,हार्ट रेट एवं ऑक्सीजन,Good for normal users.....Not for heavy users like daily activities.....Good looking on hand...App is not working properly some times,The battery power is amazing 👍🏻,It\\'s a good watch but the strap always comes out,Nice watch,Not so special but average in this price [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn\\'t have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn\\'t an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that\\'s what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It\\'s good value for money smart watch.Light weight. Touch is smooth.All the features are 90-95% accurate.,a good product in this price range must buy itGOOD LOOKINGGOOD QUALITY,Good product is mst h,Average for calling good looking,I\\'m really happy to purchase this watch! It\\'s very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well! Overall, if you\\'re looking so good brand & good features, go for this ..,Product does not turn onPlease return the item. Please. It is easy to install at home. The kit has all that is required to install the protector.It does not affect the touch or the front camera, but at times fingerprint marks are often seen on it.,The installer is so precisely made to fit the phone to attach the cover on to the screen. Not tedious at all, easy, systematic and value for money. I will only buy this screen cover from now. No issue of getting dust under the screen guard. Plus two in the pack, total value for money especially when I do not have to spend a lot of time and energy on installing a screen guard.,The screen guard is very easy to install. Spigen is time tested brand. You get everything in the pack for easy installing. There is a video available as and it\\'s very simple process as well.,Follow the steps mentioned in the included document and you should be done with installing this without issues in under 5 minutes.Works well with other spigen cases. Doesn\\'t seem to even touch the case edges.Cost wise, you could get something cheaper, but I chose this due to the brand.Plastic waste is really high. And each protector comes with a heavy plastic template. Mother earth, please forgive me :<,This is the best tempered glass for iphone 14 pro max. It’s so smooth that it almost feels like you’re touching the phone screen. The installation process is very easy. It’s truly a value for money product.,This is a very good tempered glass which covers end to end of the screen.,If you want a high quality tempered go for it. It’s not much scratch resistant but fingerprint resistant and quality is amazing,Its just like slicing a butter ,effortless & absolute value fir money . Pros -Really like the stylus. It works fine , using it from last two months. Excellent for note taking. Tip quality is good doesn\\'t wearing off. Extra tips provided. It provides all the functions which are mentioned. Charges quickly. Response time is really fast.Cons-Few times it automatically turned off while using, but not a big concern as it happens rarely.Not for professional sketching and drawing as it is clearly mentioned that it doesn\\'t support pressure features.Conclusion -For price under 2k I think it is the best stylus.I am using it with iPad air 5.Didn\\'t face any issues till now so don\\'t know how helpful customer care support is.,So, the quality of packaging and product quality is pretty good. I’ve seen it turn off in just 30 seconds a couple of times but that’s all. By the way, I ordered it for my old iPad Pro 10.5 inch A1701 as I don’t want to buy new Apple Pencil at full price and I somehow couldn’t find the right alternative for 1st gen Apple Pencil either.. but I found some questions here answering it works for A1701.. after delivery, I found out it actually won’t work and then magically the right model of stylus was on my Amazon Home Screen when I wanted to return this. Gonna order a new one which KINGONE says works with A1701. Let’s see..,Very good product build quality is aluminium so feels premium working is good as well best for note taking and basic operations budget friendly .,Full recharge is completed in 18 mins👍 affordable price.👍 Wish Double Tap Gesture as at the apple pencil 2- ND gen.,Ease of use, accurate, all is good upto now and also looks good, feels good, feels premium. Product at this price deserves 5 star,Good product,While using it automatically off\\'s itself this happen when it is in use. But worth buying than a expensive apple pencil ✏, Good charging speed, supports well for Suzuki burgman also,It\\'s dash charge OnePlus devices,Product is good , you can charge your iPhone easy.,It is built really well & is very compact in size.It also supports fast charging my Poco X3 pro (33w).Though it seems to be a bit loose for my car, it gets unplugged from the car(Ford Ikon) even if the wire is moved a bit.,Working good and small design as I wanted.,Fast charging, good quality plastic used.Value for money.Go for it.,Hi allI connected in my car and came to know its only use for charging it will not show any maps on music displayThank you,Excellent product, does it job well. Charges phones fast with USB C. With USB-A the charging speed is lesser, but not like some other car chargers which can barely keep up with battery drain from phone usage. Small size, does not come into your way. Would work for everybody. The packaging would be suspicious - you would think a cheap unreliable product. But it does the job well. You can save money on expensive car chargers, and invest some of the savings on a good USB-C cable.P.S. Tested only on Android phones. This review is based on my two days of usage. Work fine on Activity and Fitness Tracking but Sometimes Software does misbehave. Need some improvement on the Software and Not Work only with Bluetooth Connect it Requires an Internet connection for sync.  and sometimes Bluetooth does not fully Work. I believe problems which are coming may be solved by the next Software updates. Entry Label Smartwatch with calling features wise ok.,I only have one problem, sometimes it acts as a speaker, and all the sounds of whatever that is playing on phone comes from the watch. Also i would like to know if i can silent the ringtone coming from the watch. Is there any way. Please help. I am using iphone 11.,The product is really good, it feels so light during workouts it\\'s so comfortable to wear and the reason I gave 4 stars is that the sound quality is not so great,Good looking and two things are missing 1.female health cycle2.belt strap was very smallscreen touch is very smooth and u can give some lengthy strapOver all 4/5And gps also missing,This watch is good at this price range as compared to other smartwatches but it has delayed in wake up wrists feature.

This is My first 5G IQOO mobile  purchased on 26th December at Amazon. Till now i didnt feel anything bad in this mobile .Happy with the Purchase. Camera quality is Good. It works smoothly in all the options.,This is good performance handset but the quality of the camera is not good, even though they said it\\'s a 50 MP camera it\\'s doesn\\'t take that sharp picture. So you\\'re not thinking about camera it\\'s a good choice for this much amount. It\\'s also have a problem with 5g(jio) connectivity.,Touch not good,Na,Good phone but camera quality is not good enough but proccessor are great,Very nice,Budget Mein sabse mast phone,Camera quality is not up to the expectations The sound quality is excellent for the price, and so are the three buttons. However, the material quality isn\\'t good, and the wite breaks after 9 months or so.,Less bass.. good sound.. quality might be better,I like to buy this headphones,Good product,  very much I like you 👍Good sound quality. Good its really very nice product. Thank you so much samsung galaxy,I have tried many wired earphones almost every brand. But this is just perfect. Mids and lows are superb. Treble and bass are balanced well. The Remote has 3 buttons, mic works well during the call.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qrQ52Xf8L._SY88.jpg,Its not so good not so bad,Like but....? I trust this product! Works well with car play!,Very good quality and charging is fine. As good as original,Build quality is awesome, best lightening cable ever seen, better than a official  lightening from \\uf8ffIf ur looking for a cable close your eyes and go for it 🔥 or you can buy a (Amazon basics) one I was using that for past 3 years that a bit a cheaper side, I recommend both these cables had better build quality and value for money,Gr8 product overall,Just loved it, very good charging speed.,,Good quality,it well packed, all sealed coveredthe wire looks of a very good qualityrecommended!!!! It’s A Good Purchase For Long term Personally I Like It Because It came With 2 Install Kits And Costed Me Around ₹999($12) And Trust Me It’s Very Easy To Install.And It’s Protected The Device For A Fall Of Bed To Ground. Overall Nice Product! 👍,It\\'s very nice.I saw a video on YouTube and got to know that the best way to apply this is, as soon as you remove the paper which comes along the phone. Hence you can easily avoid dust particles! It worked well with me. I\\'m happy!But, scratch resistance capabilities have to be checked yet.But, it\\'s also a bit pricy!500 for 1 glass?Need to wait and check its life span and protection quality.,After putting lots of screen protectors, i found this was the easiest. No need to think about alignment as the alignment tray makes it a breeze. I found two big air bubbles after installation but those were removed very easily with the squeege tool. Overall, the process took hardly 10 mins. Just clean the screen properly before installing to avoid any dust mark below screen protector.,Good and easy to install,It’s easy to install. Quality is great. Doesn’t cause issues with camera and is better than the original screen itself in terms of touch feel,Oleophobic coating on it is really good. I’ve been using it since over 2 months now and it’s not faded at all. It’s a bit expensive but it keeps phone’s screen looking new and shiny, and it is much much better than the cheap ones in doing so; it’s night and day difference.Fit and finish is really good too. Applying it is super easy.Otherwise, I don’t see it protecting the phone screen from cracking or scratching more than the cheaper or the more expensive ones.I recommend getting this over others primarily because it’ll keep your expensive phone looking new,the product is good, easy to install, and comes with a wonderful package but it\\'s too costly, rs 1k, if u happen to get this for a discount or deal then go for it!,This screen protector is super quick and easy to install. All the tools and institutions provided makes it a breeze. It\\'s original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles. The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it\\'s in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,🔥 Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen 📱 issues some times it\\'s too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it\\'s very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.🔥 15 मिनट में उपयोग के दौरान हीटिंग की समस्या।टच स्क्रीन 📱 कभी-कभी जारी करती है यह बहुत बढ़िया है और कभी-कभी आपको टाइप करते समय सैमसंग कुंजी पैड पर भी कई बार स्पर्श करना पड़ता है।हम सभी परिवार सैमसंग मोबाइल का उपयोग कर रहे हैं लेकिन इस बार मैं मुद्दों से चिंतित हूं अगर मुझे समान मुद्दों का सामना करना पड़ता है तो मुझे मोबाइल बदलना होगा और डेटा ट्रांसफर करना होगा यह बहुत परेशान करने वाला काम है अगर कोई सैमसंग इस समीक्षा को पढ़ रहा है तो कृपया मुझे अमेज़ॅन के माध्यम से उत्तर दें .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls. She is not a selfie or video person.Didnt want to go for Realme/Xiaomi(redmi/poco) products because of their support. This already comes with Android 12 and two year updates are assured.The display is really good. Not full HD screen though. Call quality is good.I wanted a smaller size but unfortunately, the price doesnt fall under 10 for them.If you are buying for lots of photos/videos, this is not the phone for you.If you want to use for call & do basic things like whatsapp and other things, this would be a good phone for you.,This phone was bought for a first time smartphone user.  It was a good fit for the said user.  Thank you Samsung and Amazon.,Normal phone with very average screen quality. Battery backup also not very good. But yes its worth it. Thumbs up under this budget.,Samsung m04 exlent mobile. battery and screen best quality,rejonabule price,midle class best of mobile,Better price with discount. Performing well,AN AFFORDABLE MOBILE FROM A PREMIUM COMPANY. ❤️ I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it\\'s still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn\\'t ever thought that this cable will be so long it\\'s good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter\\'s old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can\\'t blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place. Oh this is really nice and sturdy product , keeps my phone stable while I draw or paint . I tried it immediately as it was delivered.Amazing .,It\\'s good for moderate usage, the metal clamp is strong & it holds the table properly. The string is quite flexible as well, Overall, okayish quality wished the string/arm would be a little strong & hold the device more firmly. Works well with lighter-weight phones,Good product received,Stability not very good, but overall it\\'s good product with this price.,Good,It has a potential to hold phone. Good product,Stability some average. But product is very good...,Clip at one side is of metal, but the other side clip which holds phone is built of plastic and seems delicate. Every time I mount or unmount my device, I have to take care a lot so that it might not get broken. Check for offera before buying,18w charging cable,,Awesome cable!Charging, data transfer and durability is simply awesome, and there is not a single disconnection issue, which I always faced in original mi cable from box. Bought 1 more time as last cable damaged when phone fell on usb cable port as my phone is heavy and I never faced any issues so i bought one more time and didn\\'t went for replacement as its waste of time and energy, i also have boat earphones that is also awesome..😄,Good,Charging is very slow. Forget about fast charging. Not useful at all,Cable is not fit properly on my samsung galaxy m31 type C port. If little hit happens then cable is plug it out. Otherwise length and cable quality is very nice,Works as expecte. Can charge as well as do data transfer. Ports fit well. I have been using boat cable for iphone for some years now and they are very durable. If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don\\'t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won\\'t run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.,This is worth for price , has the latest technical softwares and perform well for minimal usage , ofcourse it has configuration less so we should not look better than thisBattery life more than expected, we could buy for this budget range,Simple and good, ok camera,Ok,Overall good quality product,Good unit,Good,Good mobile for basic users Smart watch is good with proper large displayvoice assistance siri for iphone userscalling facilityface time facilityOne deficiency that you are unable to message or type text in WhatsappIf you have small wrist dont go for it or else its a perfect choice for your loved ones.,This is the first time that i have purchased a smart watch. A good watch for newbies like me with lots of amazing functionalities. Apart from that, this watch is a value for money at this price range. The sleep tracker works decently well, could have been better. We can call directly using the watch, i like that feature well. Need not reach for phone everytime. The screen touch is also well. There are lots of watch faces which you can change to or upload one from your own galary which is a plus point. The product looks exactly as shown in the pictures. The calorie and heart beat tracker are also quite accurate. The watch is a bit uncomfortable to watch at times, but otherwise the straps are good and strong,I have been using this watch since a month and its really great. All features are working quite well and connectivity with phone is also good.Screen quality may be improved.,Actually my smart watch BSW043 Ring 3 is not charging 2 to 3 days. It\\'s off I tired to msg fireballs but it alway say to follow our page on Instagram. And when we follow its shows you their new offers. I don\\'t know what to do now. I just submitted the warranty form.,The watch worked for the 2-3 Months and got switched off automatically and Rear Panel also got opened automatically..,I didn\\'t charge it for 2 days, now after charging also it is not getting on,I have been using this watch since a month and its really great. All features are working quite well and connectivity with phone is also good.,Product quality and look was good but have some issues after few months usage Product has good quality of metrical use,Cover is sturdy but gets yellow within 10-12 days,It turns yellow within few weeks of usage,Value for money! Local shops are selling for 600 to 1000 but this one at this price is good! Good quality, clear, Sturdy and Perfect fit 👍🏽Recommended!,Case is strong , but it turns yellow in 1 monthEven tough I have used it less,The product is Awesome , quality is very good . I really recommend this to buy for iphone users,so far this product has been absolutely amazing for me specially since i got it for a discount, believe me, it will keep your phone absolutely secured with how freaking hard and secure it is, so far not a trace of yellowing though i don\\'t use my phone a lot so yeah idk its fine so far, i can\\'t really find a downfall for this absolutely amazing case, looks fabulous too and simplistic,Premium quality back cover , looks costly and transparent Good quality. Can buy if it’s price is below 250,,Good product  but little expensive,Good product, holds mobile and mediumsize Tab.,A little costly,Very nicely designed mobile holder with good quality. The best that I have purchased so far.  Go for it.,The package arrived a days early and it is a great product for the price it’s is Very  sturdyAnd looks of good quality,Excellent product, good build quality, bigger compared to similar products. ,Overall meets the requirements nothing to say negative with respect tolthis phone,Charging is very slowly,Maine is product ko apni beti ke liye kharida tha,Fingerprint is good, battery life good, camera is ok,Good phone at this price,Nice in this range.,Best in this price range👍👍 Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It\\'s great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item. The quality is not upto mark for the price paid. Other brands offer good quality earphones with lesser price. But per my experience none of my earphones have lasted more than 1-1.5 years.Given that this is JBL, lets see how long it lasts.Can someone build a earphone which lasts couple of years? I\\'ll buy :),I had purchased two units of same headset of which one was found to be defective. Since I was on travel I couldn\\'t check the items immediately and by time I found item to be defective the return/ replacement window has elapsed.,Build Quality is average considering JBL a global brand providing u an amazing sounding earphone under 700. Highly recommended if u r a music lover.,Sound quality is awesome but not bassMic is below averageIt come out from ears if you walk fastNot for game you can\\'t hear footsteps of enemyReview after use of 4,5 earphones (c100si) 2 year experience,Awesome product....but resolve its tangling issue please otherwise nice product,Nice,After 8 months, left side speaker has no bass and not as loud as the right speaker.,Superb voice quality This was a saviour for me as I didn’t want to buy expensive stylus and max dont work with Iphones. It’s not too precise but it gets the job done. I love it,Unexpectedly this product works very well. But When I buy this, the spare disk was missing.,This item is simple awesome for this price. It is doing good without any glitches and worth buying for the price amazon is offering.,Though it is good but the tip of the stylus pen should be umbrella free....no handle grips too.,There is a delay between writing and also I get wrong color i ordered bluse and I get gray,this is a good digital pen for digital art work and very smooth working techniques using so easily,Works perfectly on Samsung S22 Plus. I often use it for video editing too. But I think it\\'s overpriced. I got it for Rs. 389 including delivery charges. It should cost max upto 250. 2 stars have been cut for overpricing.,It is definitely worth the money tho it does give some scratches it\\'s not that see tho so it\\'s fine for it\\'s price light weight I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don\\'t perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I\\'m using right now in this phone, but I\\'ll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It\\'s a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it\\'s a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good This was a saviour for me as I didn’t want to buy expensive stylus and max dont work with Iphones.

Original MI brand. Do buy it if you need a B type,Original product. Received the product today. The packing was intact though I found watch not at its proper place. It fell down inside the box and found the inner holding box damaged also. Not expecting any kind of tampering but thought to share the product packaging. Overall nice product, will share detailed review once use it for atleast a week.,Good watch through fire 🔥 boultI am impressed for this watch is so computableand all features are properly working like mean feature voice calling are properly working andThis price range are no any brand are give this feature I am Happy for this watchThank you Fire 🔥 boult,Pros: The phone supports both phone and apps calling. Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It\\'s good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it\\'s better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it\\'s close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it\\'s a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged. One feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch, there are lots of scratches within one month of usage.,All is good. Satisfied. Auto selection of sport mode is not there. You have to select each sport mode for each workout A 10bucks piece can save cable worth hundreds. Totally recommend,I just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors. Specially, apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesn’t last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear.This seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear&tear. Have applied in earphones also. Will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life.Till now, feeling good about this useful product.,Price is high,You can go for this.,It is useful. After using it, the durability of the cable is good.,Very good product it definitely protect your cable,It doesn\\'t really protect your cable if the cable is starting to wear out. You need to use this before the cable starts wearing out. It works only if the cable is thick enough. But overall good quality.,Good Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It\\'s great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item. Sometimes tap to wake up screen work. Little bit lag in touch screen.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81raP1KgBrL._SY88.jpg,Nice productsBut hand wash screen off problemRe-start problem,Automatic Restart problem,For the first time, I purchased a smartwatch. Seen many smartwatches for the last 3-4 months. Seen many brands with price ranging from Rs. 1999/- to Rs. 17999/-. This is very recently launched.Pros:-Quite nice product. Bought it for Rs. 3799/-.Amoled screen - enough brightness.Nice features.BT Call volume above average.So far fully satisfied.Many features are yet to be explored by me.Cons:- Sometimes BT connection may get broken, not very often.More I will write after few weeks.,,, Amazing product. Very useful too.,A good product.,Good value for money, bought it for 89rs. If height was 1” more would be great,It\\'s heavy and stable.Good product but can\\'t change as given in photo because space is very low near base.,I loved the build quality of this stand at this price point. The stability is pretty good and it holds my phone even with a thick case properly. There is only one downside. While connecting the charging cable with your phone in portrait mode, the cable bends sharply as the stand is quite low. But I place it on the box the stand came in and it works for me. So no problem for me at all. Value for money product.,Quality if the product is very good. It\\'s been a while since I\\'m using this. Sturdy too. Totally worth the money.,Ok,good I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it\\'s build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,Good one under This price..! One of the Best Android phone by Vivo 💚,Its super good for normal usage,Camera is ok for normal,It\\'s working fine and no issuew. Iqoo providing quality devices compared to other brands,Camera quality is not that high,Value for money,Phone is very handy and battery is also good. Quality of phone is good. Overall it is nice  phone at this price go for it,Tbh it\\'s a good phone for your parents. Of you are a heavy user then don\\'t consider this phone.Cons:-1. Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven\\'t tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months,Extent,Awesome phone, recommend to buy it.,its all okay,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513nl6zJI4L._SY88.jpg,Nice,Best 5g phone in cheap price The watch is good, the app is very bad, no Google fit integration or anything, watch face is barely customisable, I don\\'t know why they used the new noise fit prime app with it, the app is very glitchy.If you want this watch for calling, go for it, otherwise don\\'t, I hope they make this watch compatible with actual noise app.Also, wrist awake does not work properly.On the plus side, it is good for calling.,It is great for the price range. I bought it for my son and he is very happy. Can pair with a phone and make and receive calls. Nice UI, great watch faces, step count looks to be fairly accurate. All in all a good buy.,Just work like a smart watch..,Its very light weight with all the added features. Battery life is Max 1.5 day.It drains your phone charge rapidly,Nice,Like very much,Nice,Comfort and nice to see just a watch not smart one... all features are to make fool of  you,Worst watch,  connecting problem with phone nd automatically disconnecting from phone,Very good quality of product and price is very low.Very good,,ভালো ঘড়ি টা।,Dislike,After use of 2 months observed battery life is getting only one day max with only normal usage with out audio.Ok for regular usage,Superb This works by clamping on to AC vent. It holds on sturdily, minor block on AC flow is not of much consequence.The phone clamp is spring loaded and accommodates all phone sizes.Most holders working on suction does not hold onto glass. They fall off while driving. Could lead to accidents.,Good product, but didn\\'t work for me, as it was unable to hold my Moto G60 device\\'s weight. The clamp mechanism was great. I loved it! But the back clip which goes inside the AC vent was loose and kept on moving. Also the lock which tightens the back clip was average.,Received today. The product is of good build quality. It gives a feel of premium product. Not used it so cant say about functinality.,Product is good but fitment in ac vent with mobile phone placed on the holder increases weight which is not desirable,Good quality in this price range. It will however block your AC vent. Easy to mount and unmount your phone. Quite sturdy although not perfect. Has been able to maintain its composure even on bad roads. Will post the long term review after a few months. But so far so good!,good,Nice product,I am satisfied with my product Looks sturdy but there should be more space between the ports. Fitting two cables is a challenge. Beats the purpose. A grave engineering defect.,good,The adapter heats when charging for more than 30 minutes!,Small, weightless and easy to carryCharging power is good not supar fast but ok types,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nillfuZ+L._SY88.jpg,Awesome,Good one,Value for money. Bit heating up, good for carrying. I got it for 1499 and I guess for this price it\\'s good enough. Don\\'t buy if you are buying it for than this price. If you just wanna try out a smart watch, this is really nice. But if you are expecting too many features in it , then go for a pricier one. At least for this watch, u don\\'t have too many features, and you have to use your phone to set up most of the things ( like alerts and notifications, Do not disturb mode and even alarms too!!)Other than that, its touch response is pretty decent, has got nice watch faces (you can make your own as well) and battery is long lasting (at least for my usage, lasts more than 10 days).Also notice that the wrist isn\\'t black, its dark grey. But the dial is black,This item is best quality. The price is very worthable. This product\\'s overall quality is quite good. I will recommend to purchase this item.,the design of this watch is really good ... i got this at 1499 in Amazon sale and it\\'s really value for money 👍,Super,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615xQV8mNDL._SY88.jpg,Amazing look,Screen refresh rate is bit low ,but a great product for this price !,Best product This was indeed an ideal purchase. Good performance, good built, up to the mark functionality at this price. Stable and Sturdy. Recommend. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,Looks ok,हार्ट रेट एवं ऑक्सीजन,Good for normal users.....Not for heavy users like daily activities.....Good looking on hand...App is not working properly some times,The battery power is amazing 👍🏻,It\\'s a good watch but the strap always comes out,Nice watch,Not so special but average in this price The camera is good, phone is quite respponsive, fast charging.There are some niggling software issues and do not forget password (pin), there is no way you will be able to get it back to factory settings,This is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please DO NOT update your device to the latest software version. Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it\\'s best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,Above average performanceNo heating issueFastest fingerprint reader&face unloakGood battery lifeOk camera qualityLight weight,comfortable on hand,All the features of this mobile was good.no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games.withinh the budget only it was available for me.,Dual tone flash light is not working i think it\\'s only single led light,Two things missing1. Pin hole camera2. Earphones jack.Overall 👍,Camera Excellent, but battery life not good, maximum 6 hours,As this price limit its a good mobile with camera, battery, screen quality Camera : Great. No words for it\\'s outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn\\'t occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it\\'s not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn\\'t lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn\\'t play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn\\'t mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!,Good smartphone for daily use, good battery life, doesn\\'t hang much. My usage is normal and I don\\'t play games, so did not experience heating issues.

I bought it for around 14000.What I don\\'t like about this phone is camera quality. Without flashlight the photos are quite good,but when we click pictures with flashlight on the quality is not good at all..so that’s the main concern in this phone.Hope this issue can be solved with a update.There is no heating problem, phone is working very smoothly.,I am writing this review after 3 month of use. Phone is overall good. Battery life is good. Display is also very good. Phone has no heating issue although I have not played any games on the phone.,Phone is good for normal use  display is very goodBut I  faced  some jitters in while display light goes off.. it happened many times before updated the phone after update it happens rarely...,Multiple issue in Samsung M32 .1.Lock Screen password issue. We can\\'t reset the password if you get the lock screen password you have to reset mobile and there is no option for password reset.2.My Phone Samsung M32 is not getting charged after usage of 1 year.3.Sometimes phone is hang issue and not responding.4.I would recommend not to buy Samsung M series ,If you buy means you would face so many issue and will get frustration definitely.5.This is my first and last mobile in Samsung. Good one display is good battery life is very good camera quality is good for me finger printer placement is not good can\\'t be used with both hands,Using it from last 3 months now. Battery backup is good , camera is good and in this price range this is one of the good option as of now,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep but on 2dec my mobile stolen during this period I have used 7-8 hrs in a day continuesly but there\\'s no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good I think in this mobile there is one problem I face,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you\\'re into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty,Good,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don\\'t buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.,good,It\\'s a good product for normal daily use.Camera quality is not up to the mark.Overall a good product. The camera is good, phone is quite respponsive, fast charging.There are some niggling software issues and do not forget password (pin), there is no way you will be able to get it back to factory settings,This is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please DO NOT update your device to the latest software version. Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it\\'s best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,Above average performanceNo heating issueFastest fingerprint reader&face unloakGood battery lifeOk camera qualityLight weight,comfortable on hand,All the features of this mobile was good.no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games.withinh the budget only it was available for me.,Dual tone flash light is not working i think it\\'s only single led light,Two things missing1. Pin hole camera2. Earphones jack.Overall 👍,Camera Excellent, but battery life not good, maximum 6 hours,As this price limit its a good mobile with camera, battery, screen quality I was looking for a phone below 10K. I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don\\'t strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don\\'t need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don\\'t watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don\\'t need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don\\'t have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn\\'t heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don\\'t think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can\\'t especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don\\'t like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should\\'ve 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don\\'t know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... \"NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING\"NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it\\'s all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it\\'s battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it\\'s dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it\\'s amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don\\'t buy this for camera....just don\\'t. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don\\'t recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- camera😤😤,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera\\'s good, durability also seems to be good, I\\'ve dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it\\'s a little less for me. But I don\\'t have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don\\'t do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it\\'s working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine Linking the smart watch to my mobile phone was not as seamless as is to be expected for such a product. Once it was set up it works flawlessly. However, the NOISE smartwatch app on my Google does not give any data on sleep cycles and neither is there any information on how to transfer the data to another useful app such a Google Fit.,Noise pulse2max smart watch is awesome and looks goodOnly one default battery life 4 days is coming with notificationsWithout notifications it is coming upto 8 days,Packaging was not proper the package having full of oil in the package  but the brand packaging was proper so no issues with the productAfter using more than 4 months the product is really impressive and having good battery life and accuracy and the quality of calls on smartwatch are the best,I\\'ve been using the product for a while now and I gotta say I love it. The battery lasts around 4-5 days not 10 days, you do get around 10 day battery life if you disable almost all the features of the watch like heartrate sensing and not connecting it with your phone. The watch requires more software support and they should add more watch faces...,Nice product. Value for money totally !!,Good product,The calling feature at such a price point is definitely a plus, the health features are a bit not upto the mark but manageable. The screen is responsive but a bit low res.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vikO9CUdL._SY88.jpg Ok with charging. Looks very sturdy and durable.,One amazing cable for 300 bucks,Fast charging upto 25watts 2m in length and really durable.Bought it like the 4th time passed down my older cables to family members all still in working state.,Great product. Wanted this as my Portable battery has USB slot and iPad and Kindle Reader have USB-C ports. Fits my requirement perfectly. Charges very fast.,I bought it in 2019 and it almost last three years post heavy usage... Gonna buy it again! Very good quality,Good quality USB C Charging cable that enables Fast Charging for Samsung M21 as well as M33 5G 24 W seeking phones. 2 metre cable length helpful in keeping phone on desk while Charging Adaptor plugged into Electric Outlet. Best value. Similar 2 m cable costs 3x or 4x in retail market. This is best price,good,Very good overall Fast charging.,Cable seems to be of good quality, not used much as I keep it as backup in my car.,It’s good, sturdy & durable!It supports fast charging!Only thing is it’s a little expensive!,Nice product,I am writing this review after 10 days usage of this product and I found it very durable and sturdy. It is also good for travelling where you have to keep it in the bags without any kind of box. I would recommend it to all.,Best wire type c to lighting connector go buy worth of money,Value for money,I am happy with product. Quality is good. Durable. Good Quality. Works well. It shows warp charge on phone when charging. 4 start only coz the charging is a bit slower (about 20%) than the original.,Value for Money,Good 👍, but not like original,Over all good product. Decent buy,Very good product,Value for money,This cable i bought in July\\'22 end and in December mid 22 it stopped working. Not durable and not value for money for 330rs of cable lasted hardly for 5 months.,Original one plus type c cable cost around 800rs. So went to have a decent one. But received this product with almost same as original. I will write once I start using this for a while. But my first impression on this product is good. It supports warp charge 30W. Looks steady. Good built just a watch not smart one... all features are to make fool of  you,Worst watch,  connecting problem with phone nd automatically disconnecting from phone,Very good quality of product and price is very low.Very good,,ভালো ঘড়ি টা।,Dislike,After use of 2 months observed battery life is getting only one day max with only normal usage with out audio.Ok for regular usage,Superb 128GB SD Card is showing 134GBDon\\'t buy this product,It was a bit costly but prouduct is of great quality. Could have been made little bit cheaper cost wise.,All good,Fast and smooth,Ab mujhe computer ki jarurat nahi padti,Speed is fast but not as advertise I get around read speed 70MB/s and write speed 30MB/s,Good one,Product is ok. 2 months review- its been working fine, there\\'s been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn\\'t basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it could\\'ve been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, I\\'ll give it 9/10, it\\'s good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven\\'t understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i can\\'t check prove if that\\'s correct.the water resistance, I haven\\'t used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch 😗,I\\'ve used this product for 4 days, and i\\'m going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -So, Bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don\\'t get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you can\\'t silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it\\'s almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you\\'ve a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It\\'s a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super 👍. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look I was looking for a phone below 10K. I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones.

But I don\\'t have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don\\'t do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it\\'s working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine I really like this product. Gifted to my sister, and she likes it,Great ⌚,Good product,Nice 👍,Thik hai,In this price range it\\'s ok product,Color so nice..I loved it,Need some more features:( Good one display is good battery life is very good camera quality is good for me finger printer placement is not good can\\'t be used with both hands,Using it from last 3 months now. Battery backup is good , camera is good and in this price range this is one of the good option as of now,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep but on 2dec my mobile stolen during this period I have used 7-8 hrs in a day continuesly but there\\'s no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good I think in this mobile there is one problem I face,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you\\'re into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty,Good,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don\\'t buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.,good,It\\'s a good product for normal daily use.Camera quality is not up to the mark.Overall a good product. The sensors has burnt at two point of more than 3mm dia on my wrist upon wearing overnight and I have abandoned using it out of fear.  Had enclosed photos herewith.,Worst to buy, it\\'s belt quality is totally poor, performance is average, not proper tracing of activities and battery life is too average.,Value for money,It\\'s  good,Low batter life,Nice Smartwatch, Big Display, Long Battery Life, Max Features,Good,Good product I really suprise there is no Bluetooth calling and no gpsAlthough brand is good but if there is Bluetooth and gps it will be extra good for buyers,Pleas add bluthooth calling so your watch selling will increase,Its a premium build watch with mid range features. It needs a lot of software updates to fix bugs and bad design choices. I returned the watch after a day\\'s use because the features didn\\'t warrant the price i was paying for it.The same notification appears twice in the watchNotifications that i have cleared from my phone dont go away from the watch and it even vibrates randomly, showing the old notifications.When i want to clear a notification, i have to swipe to the left for the delete icon to appear and then tap on the delete icon. Why the extra step? Why not just consider swiping left as a removal of notifications?Calls on the watch only have the reject button. There is no button to accept the call from the watch.Google Fit Sync doesnt workYou can only store 5 watch faces at a time. Also the variety of watchfaces isn\\'t a lot, which is probably understandable because it just releasedWith a couple of software updates  this would be a really competitive watch, hopefully they dont abandon it\\u200a\\u200a, like they abandoned updating the OnePlus Watch,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OuSyAi-0L._SY88.jpg,Nice watch at 4499 Price I have used City Bank credit card for availing discount,,The functions are super smooth although the N-health app sometimes does not track exercise, overall the watch is great product.,Plz update and add call receiving option It\\'s a good product.,Like,Very good item strong and useful USB cableValue for moneyThanks to amazon and producer,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51112ZRE-1L._SY88.jpg,Good,Sturdy but does not support 33w charging,Nice product and useful product,- Only issue I\\'ve had is battery life.Rest it is a great product.,Very nice watchNice touch,ok.,Nice,Good product,Battery back up need to be improved... Remaining all features are good...,Ai is not working properly,Watch is good ..but I had battery issue and alarm issues rating everything is okay except voice sound during call,Battery life is very good... sound is also loud..Economical.,charger quality bad,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614VMH+hRtL._SY88.jpg,Battery lasted for 15+ days with low-medium usage. All functionality works fine. Perfect for someone wanting to limit the distractions of a smartphone.,Good product for elders,Working well for about 1 year. Everything okay,There is some disturbance in the sound While using wireless FM Its only 4 days since we are using the product and based on so far usage, review is as below :PROS :1) Looks, it looks premium.2) Features at this price range3) Battery : It seems as if the battery will easily last for a week or more with normal usage ( Have closed all notifications which saves battery )4) Steps Accuracy : Will give 8 out of 105) Magnetic charger ( easy to charge )CONS :1) Have not noticed anything till now.,I ordered 2 watches for my wife and sister. Got it at the price of 1500. I am always a fan of Firebolt. And ninja 3 is very good. Touch responce is good. Good battery life. Sleep track is very occuracy. It has all necessary features and those are quite accurate. It\\'s light weight and looks good. Over all it\\'s an excellent product at this price.,Touch screen is not so good it takes time may be i need to use it for a while for better experience,I like the sleep tacking , heartbeat measuring , Spo2 and exercise tracking .I dislike the bluetooth of the smart watch only .  I use this watch for exercises,Battery is goodTouch screen is niceAll fixtures are very good,I like the watch style and charging is so fast,Firebolt Ninja 3Felt Good  for the watch , simple and easy,Its good, value for money, overall performance is good. Good budget mfi certified lightly cable for this price . Update usage review after 3 to 5 months .,Better than the original one in matter of robustness and durability. Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified, i use it for powering my bluetooth speaker and another usb light. so it powers then nicely,Good charger my feedback is 1 month after giving is nice product.,Working with any types of USB either C-type or micro.Temperature always normal with 2.4amp ranges .,Adapter is good but tyape c cable is not good bought for Rs.188,Very best,@99 or 149 that\\'s the good deal, a normal changerlet\\'s see the warranty conditions,Good,Nice product and value for money. Nicey packed , easy to install and with good quality adhesive. Perfectly fit on the screen,It\\'s a well made basic screen protector. Application can be tricky as it comes with no aligner. But the protection it offers is goodRegards to durability to scratches..habe to wait and seeObserved the finger print recognition is affected a bit as it take an extra couple of tries to register the finger printAll in all a well made economical basic screen protector,The tempered is nice and easy to install. The adhesion could be better.,A good product at this price range,Better than other costly tempered glass,Feels premium. Touch sensitivity is good,With a little fear, I purchased this item for my new Pixel 7. To my surprise, it perfectly fits the phone, and even I was able to stick it without any bubbles. Even the touch reponse and finger print are working flawlessly\\xa0There is no guide to help you stick the screen guard, which is okay as we all know how to do it.\\xa0I recommend this product over the overpriced, branded screen guards. But yes, I am not sure how it acts in a drop, and I am scared to test it. But it feels like it will protect the phone display during an accidental drop.,Does the job. Thats it A 10bucks piece can save cable worth hundreds. Totally recommend,I just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors. Specially, apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesn’t last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear.This seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear&tear. Have applied in earphones also. Will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life.Till now, feeling good about this useful product.,Price is high,You can go for this.,It is useful. After using it, the durability of the cable is good.,Very good product it definitely protect your cable,It doesn\\'t really protect your cable if the cable is starting to wear out. You need to use this before the cable starts wearing out. It works only if the cable is thick enough. But overall good quality.,Good Overall it is nice  phone at this price go for it,Tbh it\\'s a good phone for your parents. Of you are a heavy user then don\\'t consider this phone.Cons:-1. Slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. In initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption I.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. You will not get features like slow motion etc etc. In this price range you can get these feature on other phone Or MI variantsThis is my 15 days reviewHence I haven\\'t tried every feature of the phoneWill come back soon after using it for months,Nill,Extent,Awesome phone, recommend to buy it.,its all okay,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513nl6zJI4L._SY88.jpg,Nice The sound quality is excellent for the price, and so are the three buttons. However, the material quality isn\\'t good, and the wite breaks after 9 months or so.,Less bass.. good sound.. quality might be better,I like to buy this headphones,Good product,  very much I like you 👍Good sound quality. Good its really very nice product. Thank you so much samsung galaxy,I have tried many wired earphones almost every brand. But this is just perfect. Mids and lows are superb. Treble and bass are balanced well. The Remote has 3 buttons, mic works well during the call.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qrQ52Xf8L._SY88.jpg,Its not so good not so bad,Like but....? Perfect for a 10 inch tablet both vertically and horizontally,It was the best phone holder,Premium quality and reasonable price 👍🏼,Good,Fulfil purpose, easy to carry, solid material. Think it will last long.,Nice,Liked the product. Easy to carry, portable,  foldable, lightweight.,Good This review is based on my two days of usage. Work fine on Activity and Fitness Tracking but Sometimes Software does misbehave. Need some improvement on the Software and Not Work only with Bluetooth Connect it Requires an Internet connection for sync.  and sometimes Bluetooth does not fully Work. I believe problems which are coming may be solved by the next Software updates. Entry Label Smartwatch with calling features wise ok.,I only have one problem, sometimes it acts as a speaker, and all the sounds of whatever that is playing on phone comes from the watch. Also i would like to know if i can silent the ringtone coming from the watch. Is there any way. Please help. I am using iphone 11.,The product is really good, it feels so light during workouts it\\'s so comfortable to wear and the reason I gave 4 stars is that the sound quality is not so great,Good looking and two things are missing 1.female health cycle2.belt strap was very smallscreen touch is very smooth and u can give some lengthy strapOver all 4/5And gps also missing,This watch is good at this price range as compared to other smartwatches but it has delayed in wake up wrists feature. Overall good look, good performance, good quality and affordable price.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Saf3ahXhL._SY88.jpg,Very nice texture of this watch.  It is light in weight.  Very comfortable to wear.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oENyrSG2L._SY88.jpg Quite firm and steady. I wish they used a little metal or hard fiber for this Like bobo company holders. But great product at this price.,Good product and good quality,stud should be provided to fasten the rear screw,Everything is good but it suppose to have a locking system bcoz anyone can remove easily at parking areas,Value for money,Quality is good,I wish there was a proper instructions manual other than on the box but it\\'s not hard to figure out. The product is amazing. It is Sturdy and steady even on bad roads. The phone is completely safe. Buy this product without thinking twice. I loved the product so much that I have to order one more because my family members need one too.,avarage quality PROS: Very sturdy and stable. Not easily knocked down by kids. No fear of falling over.Mobile holder stand is very flexible, easy 360 degree rotation.Mobile holder also pretty tight., very safe to keep the mobile.The adjustable clamp is wide enough to suit any width - you can fix it on very slim or thick surfaces. Holds well.Easy to assemble according to the instructions given on the website.Overall, very satisfying.CONS: A bit tight when it comes to the gooseneck clamp. So quick adjustments (to length) may not be possible while watching.. But that adds to the sturdiness. So that\\'s okay.The mobile holder also is a bit tight to insert the phone and remove. But again, you needn\\'t fear about the mobile loosening and falling off.,For the price it is the best, it\\'s hard but without hardness it cannot withhold a weight of tabletSo the the hardness makes sense,Not bad it\\'s okaysVery nice product bro value for money but you ask the store in this product how much other ways the quality and material are good,Better for streaming videos because if you fit your phone in this and then touch it then it moves due to the weight of phone or use this for any work where you don’t have to touch your phone frequently such as video calling or voice calling etc.  Otherwise it’s good,Very useful for students for their online study, aslo useful for movie lovers.,Using for Kindle on bed. Quite sturdy and good clamp. Length of wire should have been slightly more by 9 inches which will enable user to hold the mobile/ Kindle at a good distance.,The length is not great but the product is perfect for its prize and solves the purpos, using it as a bed arm,Works well enough, it isn’t really stable and tend to vibrate and shake when holding tablet and some heavier phones.Also I can only hold phone horizontally, that means it gonna block charging ports and speakers. Good quality tempered glass. Best part is these guys are extremely prompt in customer service and warranty issues,Product quality good, but over priced. Also there is a small gaps from the edge, but can be ignored.,I got two screen guards (for 14 pro & pro max ) & installed only the one on the 14 pro. I’ve been used to fixing screen guards for multiple types of phones from multiple brand screen guards .My honest review after the installation - I really liked how easy the installation was, the coverage of the screen guard across the entire screen & the finish of the product once installed . Hope to put an update after a period of time on how the screen guard coped with my rough use .,Good,The product came well packed & is durable. Infact much better than other organisations who try to sell you same stuff with inflated pricing. the product stays on for long and has all the qualities to be called a top product,I recently purchased a screen guard for my smartphone and I am extremely happy with my purchase. The screen guard was easy to install and it fits my phone perfectly. It has provided excellent protection for my phone\\'s screen and has prevented any scratches or damage. The screen guard is made of high-quality material and it is very durable. I highly recommend this screen guard to anyone who wants to protect their phone\\'s screen. It is a great value for the price and it has exceeded my expectations. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and I will definitely be purchasing from this company again in the future.,Quality of the glass is good. Have been using it from last two months the scratch resistant coating works fine.,I had issues with initial application of screen guard (I phone XS) and then I contacted customer support to get it resolved. They immediately responded back and the issue got resolved. I am very much happy with the purchase and I am planning to get another one for my Samsung M 42 5g. Lital bit ok,Good design but china product,It changes the angle and gets loose in a few days only,Very poor quality,It\\'s worth and good quality,Very good quality,,I like the quality of the phone holder its amazing I used this mobile Last 2months overall very good i am very satisfied buying this and no lag no heat you can go for it,Nice phone looking good and over all good for this price,good,Everything is good, but the voice of recorded call is very low.,Fentastik,Good. But brightness level is naturally low in this phone brand,Gud,It lags and hangs a lot and there are too many ads and inbuilt functions in the phone which are very annoying. The product is handy and really feels good to hold. It supports fast charging.It takes around 5 to 6 hours to fully charged it.The only down side is that, it just has 2 outputs 1 usb 2 and another USB C,It is good is if you want a budget power bank but maximum it last up to 2.5 charges in Apple 12 pro max the charging is super fast the disadvantage is it take so long to get recharged,Gud product. Lightweight considering 20 k charge but slow charge. I have a fast charging phone and doesn\\'t charge fast enough. Lightweight. Easy to carry. Charges fast too. Overall gud. Got at discount of rs2000. Satisfied,It is not fast charging to my mobile One plus Nord 2.,Initial review post 1 month usageCharging time - More than 6 Hours with fast charging power cable & power adapterCharging phone - Can charge a phone 3-4 times(tested with 3400mah battery)LEDs - Utter waste. So mild that it cannot be seen from a distanceThis power bank truly delivers as mentioned. I was able to charge my 1+7T phone 3 times fully with still some charging left in power bank. It took around 1.5 hours to charge my phone completely. Absolutely amazing product at offered price, you can go for this one. Also tried dual feature i.e. charging power bank & at same time charging phone and it works well no problem. Did not face any problem with power bank heating issue while charging phone or itself. Type C charging port for power bank is good so you don\\'t have to carry two different cables and type A usb cables are hard to find.Few cons what I felt after using1. Charging cable provided along is of no use, it does not support fast charging. Hence used fast charging cable for both charging phone & pw bank.2. LEDs is of no use from a few feet distance. As they r so mild to be seen from a distance. You will have to hold PB very near to actually see LEDs. Although not a deal breaker but definitely 1 star deducted due to this.3. Bulky very bulky, definitely cannot be carried in a pocket. Not a deal breaker again.,This powerbank is the daddy of them all. Considering the amount of juice packed into it, it\\'s form factor is manageable. It holds a whopping 27k mAH of charge. Can reverse charge another powerbank. It charged up a 8k power Bank from 0-100% in around 18min while it dropped from 100-75%. 4 LED indicators, indicating the quartile of charge left in the device is very useful. I\\'ve not yet had to even once struggle to charge the device as even with heavy usage daily, I barely drop to 75% before I recharge it. It retains charge very well too. Solid buy, you literally have a generator in your pocket.,Worth for money,Charging is fast. Supplied with USB to C cable only.C to C cable and adaptor are required to use the another charging / discharging port. Hence additional cable & adoptor are to be purchased separately.Other manufacturers supply along with c to c cable even with lesser cost. Good one display is good battery life is very good camera quality is good for me finger printer placement is not good can\\'t be used with both hands,Using it from last 3 months now. Battery backup is good , camera is good and in this price range this is one of the good option as of now,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep but on 2dec my mobile stolen during this period I have used 7-8 hrs in a day continuesly but there\\'s no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good I think in this mobile there is one problem I face,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing.

So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you\\'re into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty,Good,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don\\'t buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.,good,It\\'s a good product for normal daily use.Camera quality is not up to the mark.Overall a good product. Liked - Top notch display, gorgeous display, heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to 8+ gen 1. Tremendous battery life in heavy usage. Super cool device. Silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance. good sound quality. The form factor is really good. I mean the screen is flat, so it feels like a wide(not actually wide but feels like) phone also it is tall, that\\'s why it really feels good at hand. I have an iPad but all the work now can be done by phone so I am happy.Didn\\'t like it - As I had op5t i loved oxygen os, but now it feels like realme UI. Camera is worst for this price. Main sensor is good other two are useless. Company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range. I had op5t and previously op3t,both camera were good. Op10t camera is exactly same as nord 2t.Conclusion - if you looking for speed, performance, battery life, longevity, best of display, premium feel then go for it.If you are looking for OP experience like an alert slider, or a good camera then please don\\'t choose this. Either u can wait for the next OP or go for other devices. if you don\\'t bother about UI experience(i.e. oxygen) then go for iqoo9t(its far better in spec)go to gsmarena compare op10r and op10t. exactly same specification except processor and charging speed(this much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec) .,I am OnePlus user since their 1st phone. I have used OnePlus 1 , OnePlus Nord , Nord CE, Nord 5T and now 10T. I have been using 10T as my primary phone since last 1 month.  Everytime OnePlus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because OnePlus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them . When I saw 10T first time , somewhere in my subconscious mind I had taken my decision to buy this beast. But before I reviewed so may phones, from One Nord 2 to  iPhone 14.My ratings :Design and build: 9/10Camera quality: 7/10Battery backup and charging time : 9.5/10Performance: 9/10Undoubtedly design and build is unmatched. So sturdy and beautiful. Camera quality might be discussion point. They should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad. Noone can beat it\\'s battery charging time and backup time. Within 20 min 0 to 100% , highly impressive. It will survive around 1 day for average user. Performance is good , installed and ran multiple apps at a time, never faced any hung issue or app carsh issue.As I said , even if wow factor is missing this time, I would say good phone with nice overall performance , design and features. If you get it in sale around 40k it\\'s a good deal . Go for it , nothing to regret. 😊,Purchased it some days ago !!Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well, it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well, I\\'m just gonna list as pros and cons !Pros : - I mean snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, you can expect amazing performance, why not top tier since it\\'s the best processor android could offer? Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but it\\'s holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff.- Build Quality is actually good, Especially the back, the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone, expect for the frame ofc, it\\'s made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later.- Software, I\\'m not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo, I feel it\\'s fast and a good ui, of course some old features not available now since I\\'ve used a OnePlus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os, just hope it\\'s not completely turned to color os.- Charging is just insanity on this one, switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one, almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and I\\'ve witnessed it several times, it\\'s just impressive but some issues and I\\'ll talk about it in cons.- Networking and connecting is fast and good! Haven\\'t faced any major issues in my networking experiences! calling is a good experience, connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast, good overall.Cons :- about the processor, like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit, although I don\\'t care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good.- Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider? Like really? at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit, not really a big fan of alert slider so I didn\\'t mind that part.- the camera setup is so so so average and stupid, aside from the main lens, the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment, this is literally the same setup from Nord 2T but just a better software optimisation, front camera is alright too, nothing that great- Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup, usually in my usage I have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day, it drains a bit more than I expected it to, also there\\'s no option available to disable 150W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery, only except for the night optimisation mode, which is kind of good in my opinion.Phone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and it\\'s products then go for it. Although Iqoo 9T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance, but this device does the job too.,So , basically I am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days. I am giving it 4 star because of Alert slider missing. Let\\'s me clear it by points.1. Battery is awesome. It will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds. It lasts more than 25 hours to me.2. Camera quality is nice. Specially night mode is awesome. Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture.3. No lagging , no hang. It runs smoothly and very fast.4. Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone.5. Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable.6. While watching any OTT , streaming quality is awesome. You can fully enjoy it .7. Speaker of phone is perfect, even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call. Audio contains lots of distortion when using speaker, Battery life is good.,I bought this phone for my staff, who can handle only these basic variety types. She is very happy and loves the color.,Nice one,Hgh,Battery backup is great. Didn\\'t like center button design. Separate four buttons would fit great rather than one square one. Irony is that it is for indian customers but couldn\\'t find Gujarati language in this phone. Overall product is good for normal usage. Bluetooth , radio, camera, memory card, dual sim, games are added features for fun.,Good Product,It\\'s amazing...and worth the cost ..the only weak point is that the response from the phone is a little late..after pressing buttons...otherwise it\\'s best under this range..,Nice one, easy use and more flexible one easy to carry, good battery life and camera quality also good not bad sound quality is good  over all value for money. I liked the watch, the battery of this watch is so good that before use i charged this watch and it\\'s been 2 weeks and this watch still have 25% battery left. And nagative side is i ordered black strap watch and i got grey strap watch and this is sellers mistake, i tried to return this and I\\'ve called Amazon help line then hear my problem and see it online that i got wrong item and then they say they will connect me to other person who will solve this and then no one pick the call the ring just continue to ring and after 5min i thought that no one is gonna pick the call ever and i disconnected and start using it. Watch have some basic futures and i like it.,One of the best product in this price range. Been using it for a year now and I have no complaints. Built quality is good. Steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands (Apple/Fossil). But I have seen worst. Touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected. This is water and swim resistant. I am not sure if it has IP67/8 rating but I believe this is dust proof as well, since I have been using it for almost a year now.Good product for this price range.,Everytime sleep mode has to activate, this should not be done. It should be automatically.,Good product,bezels are big but it\\'s ok for this price range and I am satisfied with the product.,Watch is beautiful and upto mark, only one con in this watch, you can\\'t  attend the call and revert you can only revert by messages,Nice,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeE6pWAaL._SY88.jpg, -------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It\\'s been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I\\'ve mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I\\'m quite used to it and \"I\\'m loving it\".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I\\'m keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can\\'t go wrong with this purchase. It\\'s worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can\\'t help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn\\'t find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I\\'m impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I\\'ve been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it\\'s true. So far so good. will update it after a month\\'s usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won\\'t get that ambiance. Boat\\'s website says:\"Don\\'t just be loud, be loud and clear\", Nope... sorry I\\'ve to disappoint you on this. When it\\'s loud it\\'s not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it\\'s not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I\\'m experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don\\'t know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it\\'s a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can\\'t complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it\\'s the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can\\'t find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn\\'t find this effective. Maybe it\\'s just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can\\'t make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don\\'t think Boat can beat this one\\'s quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can\\'t a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don\\'t buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I\\'d give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won\\'t regret it you won\\'t be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn\\'t find any other headphone with such a performance. We don\\'t have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don\\'t fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I\\'m not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man\\'s review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,My boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV, Laptop and my phone. I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.Value for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build, but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of  my boat headphones , i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , they\\'ve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and it\\'s still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall it\\'s very good purchase for me.,Don’t think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones. They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. Overall, I\\'m very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakas😜Sound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h🤩🤩, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhi😂😂I think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai😂😂 enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv 128GB SD Card is showing 134GBDon\\'t buy this product,It was a bit costly but prouduct is of great quality. Could have been made little bit cheaper cost wise.,All good,Fast and smooth,Ab mujhe computer ki jarurat nahi padti,Speed is fast but not as advertise I get around read speed 70MB/s and write speed 30MB/s,Good one,Product is ok. Looks good and didn’t harm to iPhone battery and as price is worth,Value for money,Best product and fast charging. Thanks!,The money is affordable and charger is good,Nice,Bought both Adapter and cable.! was very skeptical about it first but ordered based on the reviews.! However, was very happy with both the products.! Original packaging of adapter and cable as well.! Thank you,The product meets the requirements envisaged.,Value for money, Package seems like original. PRODUCTLIRAMARK Webcam Cover SlideEVENTS DATESOrder Date - 09/04/2022Delivery Date - 11/04/2022Review Date - 05/05/2022STATUSReceived and AcceptedRATINGS4.2/5.0DESCRIPTIONUsed terms in the description -->> Slider - Sliding part of webcam cover> Static Frame -\\xa0 Static back frame of webcam cover> Screen Frame - The laptop\\'s screen frameThe product is sturdy, invisible (for the mutual color theme for device and product), and well manufactured. If the device has the same matte black theme, this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the device\\'s body. As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly\\xa0the product has merged with it. The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.It is ultra-thin as described by the company with\\xa0acquiring about a millimeter thickness. This thickness can cope with the windows\\xa0laptops as they are having\\xa0the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen.\\xa0This spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid\\xa0will not harm the screen, screen frame, and laptop lower-up body. But, still, don\\'t put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers, than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself. The sliding function is very smooth, but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage.The device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids.Now, for the \"Mac Laptop \\'\\' users, it is not a product for your\\xa0laptop, and never try this product for your Mac laptops. As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers, that is there\\'s no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this\\xa0product will damage (crack/break) the plain glass screen.Installation is easy, remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker, using the scale for support, or else you could stick it a little inclined. After sticking, rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra-light pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes. And there you go for your satisfied invisible life.*Important - Even if not in use, slide it 2-5 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust.Overall, it is a good product. For me, it has worked awesome. Green Signal from here.Thank You :)SUGGESTIONSTo the Manufacturer - Notice the static frame of the webcam\\xa0cover, and make its edges (the edges close to the slider) smooth (rounding off or fillet), so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easily\\xa0slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.To the Seller - Well packagingTo the Consumer - Check for the rubber spacers/buffers provided in the laptop (like Windows laptops), if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not (like Mac laptops), it\\'s not the product for you. Even for Windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. Slide it 2-5 times once a week to avoid jamming.DISCLAIMERThe review(s) and rating(s) has(ve) been made upon personal usage(s) / experiment(s) / experience(s) / perspective(s) for specific product(s) acquired / delivered.,I usually don\\'t trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try. It was delivered within 3 days after placing the order. I received it on 12th June. First impressions were really good. I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but It\\'s been 3.5 months and there\\'s not even a single crack in my screen.𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝟰.𝟱/𝟱You will get 3 webcams covers in the package. It\\'s extremely thin. So, It won\\'t cause any issues when you close the laptop(Hp pavilion gaming used here) but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air, Asus TUF, Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. At the end it\\'s your choice.𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟯/𝟱I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak. It literally falls off after a week of applying it. I had to throw 2 of it as it became useless. I only had the last piece remaining.𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 : Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem.• Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol.• Then apply a strong Adhesive glue (I used Fevi Kwick). Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover. Since it\\'s extremely thin, I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue  will spill out and make a mess.• Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. And then you\\'re good to go.Its been 3 months after using the Super Glue technique. Forget about about falling, It has not even moved a bit. No effect on the quality of my webcam. The cover won\\'t interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. And fully covers it when you want privacy. Overall, Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,Good product,I wish I had known this before ordering. Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied it.Apple urges people not to close their MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook!!! It may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.MacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. This item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!If you are going to use it on your MacBook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. You can use it without worry on iMac as it\\'s a desktop and doesn\\'t get closed. You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn\\'t embedded inside the glass screen. If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.For disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options. One is you trust Apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. According to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.If you\\'re not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don\\'t see how there could be an issue.Why am I still giving this product 3 stars? It reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. It\\'s not a bad product. They just need to stop advertising it for MacBooks! It cost should be under Rs. 500,Buy it,Color is as per the photo but takes longer to charge. Also doesn’t charge on all sockets.Seems to work better when plugged in directly in the laptop.,Length of the cable is long so that you can happily use it for long distance as week and quality is really good,1 meter pInk charging wire for iPhone X long and strong one for use..,I have been using this lighting cable for almost a month now and the cable turned out exactly as it was shown. I took the rose gold one that matches my phone’s color. Although the metal ends of the cable was rose gold, but the whole cable was pink, which I didn’t like. I went for the 2m long cable so that i can use it conveniently even if it is charging. Though it’s kinda bulky, yet serves it’s purpose. Charging speed is fast and efficient just like the original cable had. Also quite durable and sturdy. My Apple’s original lighting cable had some problem while charging so I purchased this one after watching many YouTube videos and reviews. It was indeed a good purchase.,It’s long and good,It’s a superb product in terms of sturdiness, looks, and charging speed. Network reception is not that great.  People who call get out of coverage area message even though the phone show two bars of network .The same sim and network worked fine in my smartphone.Can use this as a secondary phone or as a backup device and cannot rely on it as a primary device .The only benifit which I saw on this is it supports VOLTE and can sync the contacts from Android phone which avoid manual taks of creating each contact manually .,Product is average. It doesn\\'t suck like the many contemporary feature phones from other brands. That being said, it\\'s not great either with some little annoyance noticed.Don\\'t expect much as its a feature phone but then some negatives are:1) There\\'s a voice distortion noticed occasionally when receiving calls. Have to end the call & redo it, then the voice is clear.Initially thought it was an issue of a particular product. So returned the phone & got a new one.However the new one also has this. Have tried some methods to rectify this including switching off the volte . Till now this issue has not cropped up yet thankfully.2) No notepad.Come on, how hard is it to give a notepad on this phone. If it can do texting & contact saving, how difficult is it to give a notepad to record stuffs?3) No YouTube.Since there\\'s no dedicated YouTube app, tried to access it from the opera browser, but to a big disappointment, it can\\'t properly load the YouTube page, let alone play any video.Yes it\\'s not a phone for constant YouTube watching. But since it\\'s a very important site, not only for entertainment, but also for information & news, it would have been great if youtube was enabled (it supports 4g, so why not YouTube?)4) The camera is very bad.Can\\'t expect smartphone standard camera, but this VGA camera is really bad. Nokia could have increased the price about 500 bucks, & give an average 1 megapixel camera on it.Sometimes we take photos not for posting on social media, but for information, like the name of a store or number of a vehicle.A basic camera that does that job is all that is required.5) Was delighted to see an \"English with Oxford\" app. Assumed they were very thoughtful to give an offline dictionary.But then upon opening, it turned out to be a demo version with \"Pay INR 50\" & \"Play 3 free trail\"Was even disappointed when upon clicking the free trail option, it required internet & was directed to the opera website.What\\'s the point to this?Other than this, the phone is not bad with some positive features like wireless radio, radio recording, big screen (compared to other feature phones), voice recorder,  torch, call recording option, converter app, stylish retro design & a good easily typable keypad.,,All os Ok but battery life is not good .While we r not useing a single call also but its draining battery life,Good add-on phone. Battery life is >7 days if usage is not very heavy. FM works without wired headphones. Call quality if good. Dual nano-sim. No profile setting option as was the case with previously released Nokia feature phones. Preinstalled games but all (except snakes) are trial version. Internet browser, facebook, music & video player are there but no option to install any other app as there is no app store.,Gud for one model in Nokia and worth for money,Bettery not works more than 4 days even not using phone,It works like any other feature phones from the 2006-2010 time, but the build quality is considerably low. Good battery life and good call quality is there, nothing special other than that. Perfect fit n finish. But slightly over priced. Overall good and useful.,Good product, proper fitting,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51U+yRuGOeL._SY88.jpg,This product is very usefull because it\\'s cover full display and body smart watch and protect any damage.screen fully protected with this product.,Too cost but its perfect & secure for smartwatch ❤ worth it  paise vasul😍,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81skvqgoYaL._SY88.jpg,Ok,Good for your watch Below is the experience so far.1. Received a defective product. Battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including Google maps. (Location was not getting captured)2. Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - Amazon app was in this phone. Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn\\'t allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don\\'t have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can\\'t replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it\\'s a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said \"phone is working now\". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980\\'s. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned \"patch issue. Software update dint happen\" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone\\'s screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.,Its really good smartphone in its range packed with features. And brand like Samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at a given price point. I still give it a 3.7 stars as battery 🔋 could be better. It also looses a point for not including a charger.,Phone looks are good. The charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger 25W original. Also camera quality is not even like 32 MP, total lied about 108 MP. Samsung UI is not very friendly and easy. Other brands have better and smoother UI.,Phone is very sleek, bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is....... Good budget model phone,you can not deny brand ,sumsung is a brand .overall good product for long use.,Good worck,Charger should have been part of it. But product looks good,Pricewise a little overpriced.Some of the cons are: a little rigid fingerprint sensor, after 2 months of use, i frequently encounter a lag when unlocking the phone, battery life not up to the mark, struggles to go the entire day even with regular use, no 3.5 mm jack, and a buggy BT.Pros: a very good camera, excellent screen, superb sound quality.If you somehow get this for below 18k, then go for it or else there are better options available. Posting This After 8 Days of Continous Usage:I came from Oneplus 5t that too because last to last week I had an accident and my 5t has dead on the spot.After watching a lot of reviews on Youtube and Amazon, I thought I should give it a chance.First Impression:-• As you all know OP 5t has small display so it\\'s hard for first 3-4 days to use/Typing because of big display.• A little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last 5t.• Solid built but it if it\\'s metal build then it will be more beautiful.• Space fusion color is looking killer.• Flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved• Display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps (i.e, chrome, brave, linkdin etc) you\\'ll notice a color change (from Black to Greyish color) that gives a cheap feel and I don\\'t know if it\\'s a software or hardware issue.Actual Review:-• While gaming (Call of duty:mobile) has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notification/calls even after mute notification ONN everything is coming on screen and it\\'s very frustrating and annoying.• Battlefield mobile ground, Asphalt 9, Clash of Clans, Battle Royale are working flowless.• Some apps like Flipkart and Airtel gives some error (screen zoom automatically while opening) might be because of android 12 or something else.• Now this is very weird that this phone reset a few setting automatically themselves when I don\\'t want that. I don\\'t want to set them everyday before using my phone (i.e, I am using Bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background run.While listing to music I want paranomic 360 sound but it reset to default automatically.• Gesture are not working fine, this can be fixed with future updates.• I admit that funtouch OS has some more customization then Oxygen OS but it is missing some basic customization feature like I cannot change accent color, shape, size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because Oneplus oxygen OS is in my eyes but I am not overcome from oxygen OS, Oxygen Os is lub• Funtouch OS is very uncomfortable for me for the first 4-5 days but now I\\'m getting it a little.• Less feature in gaming mode in comparison to Iqoo 7📷Camera:-• Average as of now takes good picture in night/evening time and selfie camera is awsome.• OIS works good as per the budget and gives value for money.• Day time picture are good but something it changes the saturation/color by itself automatically.• No heat observed while gaming/doing heavy task (minimal heat that every phone has now a days and it is 40°c outside so this is not a big deal for me.• Screen recorder and mic works awsome• Crisp clear display except the issue I told above• 6-7 SOT in one charge (0-100)• 42-44 minutes charging time (0-100)• No bugs lags observed till date• 120Hz refresh rate made it monster• Some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use Adb commande to remove permanently.• A few apps are unnecessary like browser and a screen (virus scan) comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow I stopped that.• Speaker volume is sufficient (enoug loud in a room)Conclusion:-In 31k it\\'s worth for money with Snapdragon 888 processor and intelligent chip.Only thing that I don\\'t like is funtoch os because it not gives a premium flagship phone experince.Has some bugs as of now (i.e, In gaming mode, in a few apps, camera, Display) that might fixed with future updates.Overall worth for money, And Yes you can pick it over Oneplus 9RT (like I said you\\'ll probably feel bad for a week with it\\'s Funtoch Os but you\\'ll be okay with it after sometime.Just because of oxygen os spending 8-10k is not a great idea I think.,Camera quality is good , Video stability is awesome, processing and other functions are nice .  UI is not that good and battery life is not upto the mark,Pros:- Super fast app experience due to Snapdragon 888- Super fast charging- good display but not comparable with Super Amoled of Samsung/ other phone- Good large display size- No heating in general use. Only seen when using camera /video call but it cools down fast.- Accessories given with the phone like Fast charger, USB c to 3.5 female adater, thin screen guard and translucent back cover.- Ok camera:Cons:- Display is not super amoled or vivid like Samsung A or S Series phone- Battery drains fast- Avg front camera- Earth current can be felt when touching back camera while charging.,I was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD 888 has its own share of heating issues and all, but for 28k, this is one of the best phones in the segment.I had Pixel 6A and Nothing phone 1 as other options. Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects, the performance, the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible.Also Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so it\\'s a plus point.The only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to 60Hz. It starts to act as it lowers to 30,40 fps or something. And the battery life is average. It\\'s 1 charge in the evening for sure. But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enough.I use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style. Recommended to all.,Good display, good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass, smooth experience, camera good but front video could be given 60 fps, good haptic, every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better. Overall satisfied with the product.,They are ok, i can rate 2.5/5,Mobile is worth its money.,Idont use fingerprint and camera are very good battery life ok Good Prodat,Battery life is so bad.,Nice product,Dislike product also not return its only replacement,,Iska tauch kaam nahi kar raha hai aur kewal mobile adoptot se charge karne par on dikh raha phir turat band ho ja raha hai.ise wapas karna hai.,पहिल्या दिवसापासूनच ती वॉच ऑन होत नाही. चार्ज केले तरी पण ऑन होत नाही. पुर्णपणे third class वॉच पाठविली Amazon ने. दिवसेंदिवस Amazon ची सर्व्हिस आणि प्रॉडक्ट bad होत चाललेले दिसत आहे.,Bhot Jada ghatia h h,All the products are very good working there is no any issue till now.

The film protecting the tempered glass is black opaque. You can’t see whether the ear opening aligns with the phone’s ear piece. You can only guess. It can be made transparent for better accuracy.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LMZQ86RwL._SY88.jpg,Best Tempered glass for iPhone 14.

It is very responsive. I am very happy to use it. The only challenge was applying it as its not very easy even with the help of guiding strips. They tend to slip. But after applying there was no air bubble and screen works smoothly.

I am using my wired realme buds 2 earphone and MSI gf63 laptop to test it. My feedbacks:My mic is working properly.No issue with left and right sound.Build quality is also not bad, splitter used flat cable which seems durable.RECOMMENDED 👍,Good product overall. I needed this type of adapter for connecting my mobile headset to my Pc for listening & recording so it\\'s working well on my Pc but only problem is if the earphone jack is inserted fully to the line out socket of Pc (front side), the sound is very low so it needs to be inserted 3/4 only & in that way full maximum sound coming,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ytYJ9ba7L._SY88.jpg,Good working with boya m1 mike.,When I decided to buy this, I found this with good reviews and Amazon recommended. After using it for many months, there is no disturbance in the quality, both mic and sound.Since I use Laptop and Desktop with same earphone, I need to frequently connect and remove the earphone from the cable, the cable is connected to Desktop, to connect the earphone directly in laptop, having done this so many times there is no issue when it comes to quality.I have recommended this to my colleagues and they also have liked the performance.You can buy this without hesitation.,The headphone jack works well, but when I put the mic jack in the pc, it creates a lot of noise which I am easily able to hear. It causes a bit of irritation sometimes. Elsewise the product is quite good,Great product and really durable.,Good product This smart watch is very nice one. It\\'s battery back up is also very nice. Bluetooth connectivity is also excellent. But, wheneveor i try to see share price it takes few more seconds by pressing side key.

Good for tracking daily steps and heavy exercise.Once charged fully, battery discharges within 4 days.,Thanks for offer,Best in market,Watch is nice but some features are not there like ai assistant while the other low budget watches have,Worst customer support noise has I have raised the complain 3 times but no one has contacted me yet and really worst if we call customer care it takes half n hour to connect they will tell our executives will call you and get the products no one is calling after 2 days they complain has been solved and closed,I did not use.  Sleeping track yet but  touch screen and over app experience is very nice and. Display quality is also nice,Nice product I was looking for a phone below 10K. I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don\\'t strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don\\'t need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don\\'t watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don\\'t need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don\\'t have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn\\'t heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don\\'t think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can\\'t especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don\\'t like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should\\'ve 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don\\'t know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... \"NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING\"NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it\\'s all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it\\'s battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it\\'s dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it\\'s amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don\\'t buy this for camera....just don\\'t. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don\\'t recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- camera😤😤,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera\\'s good, durability also seems to be good, I\\'ve dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it\\'s a little less for me. But I don\\'t have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don\\'t do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it\\'s working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine The cover felt sturdy and came in sealed package. There were protective films covering the cover from both side which had to be removed before putting cover on the phone.The fit was perfect and to take off the cover we might need to use some force . Overall the quality is good , will update after few months of usage about the colour fading/scratches.,The cover wraps around the iphone 14 pro max too tightly, making it difficult to remove once put. But at the same time, the cover feels solid and sturdy, providing complete protection the phone.,Excellent product. Avoid local market product for such premium phones 100% value for money,Excellent,normal transparent one but the price they are asking is too much. Like they are trying to loot ppl.,Awesome,Bought this as spigen is a decent brand. This is my initial case as I am waiting for better cases to be designed and released. Overall a decent case with decent protection for the phone and cameras.,This product is of good quality Expect it will last long, price wise it\\'s a good product. Till date it\\'s working well.,One slot got out of order and one using now.value of money and second slot of the charger is average to use.🤪🤪🤪😂😂🇮🇳,Good quality no issues till now working fine with 5v 2ampAs it is 10 watt charger.,Fast charging,Yes it\\'s very nice,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pgVx61I7L._SY88.jpg,Amazing product. Great charging power even two devices  connected with the charger. I charged my pixel 6a and wireless headphone together, both get charged quickly. But issue with the build quality. I once by mistake sat in the charger and the socket end of it broke from the edges and came out completely. I had to fix that with a fevi quick. Now working fine . Overall a very good product. Don\\'t think, just go for it.,It\\'s a good product for this price range. Works fine. Doesn\\'t always stay at the neck of the cable, but does help in reducing bending and stress. I would however recommend just getting some L-connector cables to avoid this issue altogether.,Good useful product,Weak packaging, but all the pieces came. They are not the most sturdy, but they are value for money, would repurchase,Good product,This cable protecter is really saved my cable.very easy to use , got so many in one pack.must buy product,Definitely not worth the huge MRP quoted, paid 99/- for 12 pieces.The material seems to be recycled. Remains to be seen if it will last. Serves the purpose of strengthening the flex point for cables. I have installed these on all my USB charge cables.,Simple and good product.,,Best Solution to broken wire Good phone,Ok,Nice product in this range.,Performance is fine, it is not a C Type charger. But Q/A mentioned as c-type,As of now its fine, will write off after using 15 days.,Good mobile at reasonable price!!,No finger print reader in this model. Never expected a phone with 4GB Ram and 64GB Rom would come without fingerprint reader.,Good mobile Its only 4 days since we are using the product and based on so far usage, review is as below :PROS :1) Looks, it looks premium.2) Features at this price range3) Battery : It seems as if the battery will easily last for a week or more with normal usage ( Have closed all notifications which saves battery )4) Steps Accuracy : Will give 8 out of 105) Magnetic charger ( easy to charge )CONS :1) Have not noticed anything till now.,I ordered 2 watches for my wife and sister. Got it at the price of 1500. I am always a fan of Firebolt. And ninja 3 is very good. Touch responce is good. Good battery life. Sleep track is very occuracy. It has all necessary features and those are quite accurate. It\\'s light weight and looks good. Over all it\\'s an excellent product at this price.,Touch screen is not so good it takes time may be i need to use it for a while for better experience,I like the sleep tacking , heartbeat measuring , Spo2 and exercise tracking .I dislike the bluetooth of the smart watch only .  I use this watch for exercises,Battery is goodTouch screen is niceAll fixtures are very good,I like the watch style and charging is so fast,Firebolt Ninja 3Felt Good  for the watch , simple and easy,Its good, value for money, overall performance is good. Very Bad mobile,Best mobile.,Phone good but charger Nani aya,It\\'s good,The phone serves all my purpose..very good one❤️,Value for money,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71veEcoG5-L._SY88.jpg,Phone works well. It’s a no brainer to get this. Just that the edges don’t fix in properly. There is always air bubble kind of thing on the edge.,Easy to apply and no bubbles. For Rs 150 they send 2 units which is amazing too. Satisfied with the purchase !!,Overall good and easy to apply. Doesn’t cover 100 percent of screen a small gap is there in edges,Adhesive could have been stronger. Popio has great screen guard at much better price.,See if you own an Iphone then popio is the best out there.I got this tempered glass because my last one broke during a fall from the stairs. & my last one was from popio too. So I odered another & the prices are a steal (like seriously I wonder how do they manage it for so cheap)Buy it without a doubt its a genuine product.PS I like little note they left with the product.,Fed up of buying those exaggerated priced tempered glasses and looking for near by shops to apply it.This product is priced for its value and lesser than other products in the market.Bought this product after scrolling for the best on Amazon and ordered it. Honestly I was never satisfied with any other product like I had with popio product. A big thanks to the team!Bonus is DIY. I never tried anything self before but after following their guide and videos I was able to do it right at first time. I really felt DIY is convenient and no need to worry about finding near by stores who could help us apply/install it.,Got it for my iphone 14pro. Im using my phone with a ringke camo case and this screen protector fits inside snug.Install this glass with the case still on the phone else you may align it imperfectly and may cause fitment problem.Overall a good buy.,The quality is excellent. Refer to the installation video by scanning the QR code on the package; it is very easy to install using the guide stickers. The quality is good, and it covers the screen entirely, leaving just enough space on the edges for the cover. Previously bought amazon basic USB type A cable and i didn\\'t last long, but this USB C product seems manufactured with high quality materials. Supports fast chagrining, data supply etc. just go for it,Exllent,Very satisfied with this purchase, just like orginal quality . Will buy again in future .,My sister is using this cable to charge her phone and the cable is durable and good enough for my sister\\'s phone. Love it!!,I bought it to use Android Auto on Tata Altroz car by connecting to my one plus nord 2T mobile.I have been using this for more than a week now. It\\'s working perfectly..I am happy with the product so far.,Basic,Great product money worth,No issues There are small scratches on the back apart for that the product is good.,Descent product. Exactly the way u wanted. Simple to look and transparent. Ordered for blue colour iphone,Case is good. The cutouts, the material, the camera bump all are very good. The back is transparent and made of glasstic, so it won\\'t turn yellow but gets scratches easily.Overall recommended.,Great protection, buttons are comfortable to press, especially considering the price. Only problem I had with was the design, maybe a personal thing it\\'s just not that good. P.S looks great on black iPhone just not on any other😬,Fit of cover is proper with raised edge for camera. This is what I wanted to have. Overal satisfied with the product,The fitting is perfect with raised borders overall and camera.Polycarbonate is hard enough to protect.The design is perfectly blending with the phone colour.A very good product at this price range I got it for ₹469,Awesome cover, Liked the product.  Accurate to my usb apparatus.,Good value,Till now i had purchased about 20 cables both micro and c type for myself and my family in this last one year. Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price,na,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that, i am sure it is not very durable. the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex. the wire will break before the connector does!!warning: usb micro connector has a strong hook. be careful while plugging and unplugging, or you may damage your device.very cheap and usable cable for 120 rs,Super power,Nice product.,In this price this is the best one i use it for powering my bluetooth speaker and another usb light. so it powers then nicely,Good charger my feedback is 1 month after giving is nice product.,Working with any types of USB either C-type or micro.Temperature always normal with 2.4amp ranges .,Adapter is good but tyape c cable is not good bought for Rs.188,Very best,@99 or 149 that\\'s the good deal, a normal changerlet\\'s see the warranty conditions,Good,Nice product and value for money. If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don\\'t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won\\'t run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.,This is worth for price , has the latest technical softwares and perform well for minimal usage , ofcourse it has configuration less so we should not look better than thisBattery life more than expected, we could buy for this budget range,Simple and good, ok camera,Ok,Overall good quality product,Good unit,Good,Good mobile for basic users I have purchased it for my galaxy watch 4 44mm it fits perfectly and the touchscreen works good. But packaging should improve.,I am writing this review after using the product for 1month. Nice case for samsung watch 4, no touch problem I faced till now. Best thing about this case is it comes with warrenty so that you can replace it if any defect product you received.,Fells hard plastic.Lookwise it\\'s good,There is an air gap between the screen and the case, which means it\\'s made for a thicker body, which means it\\'s made for the watch 4 classic. You have to press hard on the screen guard so you actually touch the screen.DO NOT BUY FOR WATCH 4.Otherwise it should be ok for watch 4 classic, though I cannot confirm .The case has integrated screen protector and protects the sides . Obviously it doesn\\'t cover the back. The blue looked weird on my black watch 4.,Overall from a protection perspective the product is very good. Look is good. Only the touch screen sensitivity needs to improve.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7160DgLoRUL._SY88.jpg,Perfect product for samsung watches, It\\'s been 15 days since i using the device extensively.I bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs. 41,999 ( including 6k instant discount coupon).First let me be clear , I bought \\' S20 FE 5G \\'with Snapdragon 865 , not \\' S20 FE with Exynos \\' and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .This review may be long but it\\'s worth to read it if you\\'re buying this product.Let me divide between the Pros and Cons.First i would like like to start with Pros of the Device ,Pros :1. Display :Samsung has been already popular for it\\'s AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . It\\'s been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( PS : No tint issues )The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn\\'t faced any issues with it .2. Stereo Speakers :As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.Believe me , you can\\'t find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , it\\'s almost like flagship devices ..Both the speakers are adequately loud.3. Battery :As a person who\\'s shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.But I didn\\'t even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT ( Screen on Time ).The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.I didn\\'t checked battery life at 60Hz because i didn\\'t use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.4. Rear Cameras :I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..Added Some Camera Samples above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )Both the three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) performs very well.If you\\'re a camera guy you should definitely check this out.5. Performance & RAM Management :I\\'m not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.I didn\\'t faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 4-5 appsbackground at single time and i didn\\'t have any issues of closing down the apps .6. ONE UI :I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but I\\'m now got used to it.PS : I didn\\'t found any kind of ads on my device as i didn\\'t sign up or used any samsung Apps.7. Build Quality :Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..8. Future Proof :  The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.IP68 & Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.This is the best future proof device as of now.So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .Now let\\'s move to the Cons.Cons :1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX :  As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesn\\'t have HDR support.IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .2. No 256GB Variant :  This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.But if you\\'re a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..so you can use a Sim card + expandable memory card ...3. Gorilla Glass 3 :  Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3 ( Which also I\\'m not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS & IT WILL BROKE.4. No headphone Jack :  It is not any kind of unusual thing .most of the phones above 30K segment doesn\\'t have headphone jack.So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .Note : Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.5. No 25W charger :  It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .but it may be a con for you ,  Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.I didn\\'t have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.For the reference of Charging speed ,Both 15W & 25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15W charger.Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.6. Front Camera :  I am not a selfie guy , but if you\\'re a person who\\'s looking for a selfie device just don\\'t buy it . it\\'s not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it\\'s not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeCONCLUSION :If you\\'re a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn\\'t bother youJust buy it , I am sure you won\\'t be disappointed.,It\\'s been about 15 days since I got this phone.  I got it for 29990 on prime day sale. For the price it\\'s good.Pros :1. Camera.  Coming from Poco X2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. It gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. It has OIS which is very apparent while recording. At 4k60 the stability is worse. But set it to  1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots. Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. Attached samples.2. Display : Absolutely best. Samsung displays are the best. 120hz FHD. Flows smoothly.  Colors and calibration is top notch. Brightness is good but I felt it\\'s a little insufficient under direct sunlight. It\\'s visible but could be better.3. OneUI : The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. OneUI4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. It has way too many customisations in it and let\\'s you personalise your phone to a very high degree. Like there\\'s a feature to read out the name of the person who\\'s calling if your wearing headphones. It took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. Also Knoxx security is a special mention. Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. And many more such good features. While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. Unlike MIUI or other skins, it doesn\\'t stutter much and bugs are less.There are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. Nice premium build quality. Good data and wifi speeds. Other such features that you won\\'t notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.Cons1.  Software.  I know I said it\\'s a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates.  This phone was launched in 2021 March in India and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates.  But there\\'s a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android 14. It will receive A13 for sure. There\\'s a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. Basically the phones life maybe 2.5 to 3 years if they give a14.  But 1.5 to 2 if not. I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while I was few say it\\'s not. It\\'s hard to say who\\'s correct.  So assume it\\'s not getting a14 if you are going for it.2. Battery.  The battery on this phone is 4500mah and it\\'s good enough for a days use. But that\\'s because I use it lightly. Not much online streaming. No gaming light social media and other usual stuff. If you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. If you\\'re going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,it\\'s better keep a power bank handy. In terms of Screen on time numbers, I once got 7 hours of sot on light usage, 1 hr YouTube and 1.5 hr streaming. I was at home and used wifi all the time.I got 3 hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip. I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home. On a mixed use day,  you can get 4.5 to 5.5 hours of sot.Final verdict : The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models. But if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years,  better avoid it. In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales,  the price might further drop to 25k even. I am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.As always amazing delivery by Amazon. Product is good , and also it\\'s  strudiness .But no fast charging in this cable , it\\'s normally charging . I love it because it\\'s supported in micro usb , or type c . Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it\\'s okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel. I need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank. Will recommend.,Best cable,good,Both Micro USB & Type C mobile connector\\'s are getting charge.Good Decision to purchase this product.,Cable is a good fibre braided with good length.The connector also has a tight fit, sometimes you have to apply a bit force to remove(ig it\\'ll wear off after usage).In comparison, boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pin.,I like the product bcuz it\\'s help me to charge both phone Type C & Micro Cabel Everything is fine but it is bulky and hard, it should be softer and thinner.....,Thank you  Amazon very good charging cable 👍,Good,Good one,quality is good. worth for 150-200 ₹. short but durable.,Very Good product .

The service from WeCool support team is super cool as well.,Good product....but more efficient expected,Amazing Product. As a Youtuber and an Instagram Content Creator, this is the best gadget I like to have in my Back bag all the time. I even use this to record my live classes without making any scenes out there, since this is very handy and lucid. Moreover, their service is excellent. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING REVIEWS?

Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it\\'s a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn\\'t look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don\\'t find it good enough if I compare it with Boat\\'s App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band. Product works well and charges the devices in a quick mannerValue for money.,I like this product,Not working 😔 after 12 days I really appreciate the build quality,Over all product quality is decent with only draw back that telecopic arm only extends less than 60 cm which in my view is little less..,I purchased and after one year of purchase my selfie stick working without any fault battery backup too good it is easy to connect and take photos and record YouTube video best for recording video self recording with tripod stand it is so good easier to stand at any place for more check my YouTube channel #aamtech2,I really like this stick and it\\'s blutooth remote.Light weight and easy to carry and have multiple optionsOnly problem with this stick is you can\\'t click vertical photos when in stand modeIf the 360 degree mode was available this would be best,,Overall good. But as the stability is not rock solid, you have to be a bit careful about placing the phone attached to this stand.,Bahut he aachha selfie stick hai. Bluetooth se connect ho raha hai. Jo ke bahut he aachha hai. Or eesame stand ve diye hai. Jis se mobile ko ek jagaha par rakha kar bluetooth remote ke madata se photo le sakte hai.,Go for it.. reasonable price and above average product. -Packageing was fine- Haven\\'t tested it working functionality yet.-just got the bank and the first light is not working idk why need to check and if it continues Ill return it ASAP,Good device for such cost,Good for fast charging,GOOD FOR  SMARTPHONE\\'BATTERY EXTENSIONS .,The product is very big and heavy.  Would have been better if it had Li-Ion batteries to save space and weight.  The product charges iphone about 50% in an hour, but rest charging is very slow.  It has a dedicated light (green) to depict fast charging mode.  The device helped me survive 2.5 days without charger, where it charged 3 phones.  I had 1 fast charger compatible Samsung phone (M30), 1 ordinary smart Samsung phone (J7 Prime) and one iphone SE, which it was able to keep afloat.  Please note, if try to charge multiple phones, then fast charging is NOT available on any port, USB and USB-C (PD).  Flights allow only in check-in baggage, so, keep in mind that you would have to carry this bulky device with yourself.  Dimensions: 6\"Lx3\"Bx1.1\"thick.  Not weight on scale, but seems like 1/2 kg and that is a lot of weight.,This power bank full charge at 12 hour and I phone 12 will be 4 time full charged not 6 time,,The charging is super goodI haven’t touched my phone charger for 2-3 days and completely used this power bank for charging and still it wasn’t dried outBut the problem is weight too heavy i must say Good quality product,Good product and keeps my charging organized. Happy with my buy.,I was looking a the pics uploaded by seller and assumed them to be large enough to fit a 6.5 inch mobile. To my surprise they are very small. I am not sure how long it can carry the weight of my mobile before it fells down.The slit to put your mobile and charge is very narriw. If mobile has good cover then it will not fit into the slit.,MODEL AND PURPOSE WAS MEET BUT UNABLE TO PASTE IT IN WALL DUE TO GUM NOT ADEQUATE,The product is good.,A very good quality product but costly.,Arch gap should have been more to keep the mobile easily,does what it says. excellent product Perfect buy for the price of 1999/-After use of 10days my overall rating is 8/10 following are my reviews.Pros:1.step counting accuracy 85-90%2.sleep monitor 95-100% accurate3.Notifications and bluetooth connection with IOS and android - 10/104.touch sensitivity 9.5/105.watch brightness in bright sunlight - 9/106.customisable watchface and easy interface - 9/107.call quality and speaker volume - 9.5/108.Sports modes 9.5/10Cons:-1.battery life 6/10 when fully connected for notifications and calls lasts 3/4 days only. Else if used optimally, can last 7-8 days with moderate use.2.less choice of inbuilt watch faces3.Watch strap could have been of better quality.4.Screen can catch scratches, need to buy a cut screen guard for the screen.Overall this Smart watch is a beast in this range (₹1999)P.s: I have used colorfit pro 2 earlier. Ratings and reviews are according to that.,Everything is great in this Watch it dose have calling , games , fin perfectly in all hands health tracking and etc, but after all watch is great but there is only one con - batter backup is less battery gets discharged in just 15 hours if you will keep it wear all day , i hope fire boltt will fix it. Overall best value to money product 👍👍👍,Many watches comes with the same features at the same cost so u may have a lot of varieties to get confused with,though i can say that this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn\\'t fit them,don\\'t worry.Even i thought it wouldn\\'t fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,Got delivery in a day. Prompt service by Amazon. Package was sealed. Did not find any tampering. Watch body is plastic built. At this price point, could have been metal one. Detailed review will be shared in few days,Now after the battery gets fully charged it drains from 100 to 0 % in just 10 minutes .i don\\'t know what happened to it .,Watch design is good. In picture shows dark grey color watch but i recived silver grey. Screen wakeup time is slow otherwise everything is good.,Using this watch for couple of days now. Overall I liked it. Readings are almost correct. Hope it\\'ll be durable as well.,Value for money.Only con is that rise to wake up sensor works very slow. Good quality. Can buy if it’s price is below 250,,Good product  but little expensive,Good product, holds mobile and mediumsize Tab.,A little costly,Very nicely designed mobile holder with good quality. The best that I have purchased so far.  Go for it.,The package arrived a days early and it is a great product for the price it’s is Very  sturdyAnd looks of good quality,Excellent product, good build quality, bigger compared to similar products. I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don\\'t perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I\\'m using right now in this phone, but I\\'ll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It\\'s a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it\\'s a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good Works the purpose of OTG for samsung galaxy A7 tab,It is little bit tight for my realme c type mobile. But works. No problems,Very useful. Easy to use. Reasonable price.,Nice one otg,After searching multiple products in the market for my ipad pro and ended up with unsupportable products and finally found this one. Those who are really looking for an otg for your ipad this is highly recommended,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816nZ1C3DDL._SY88.jpg,It was good to use and also its fasttt.,Good product After 10 days of use bhaut acha chl rha ha and I will review again aapko bata dunga kessa ha Thoda time BaadBut Product acha ha Abhi tak kuch kharab nahi hua and mene bhe isska khayal rakha ha,pencil is good working good but build could be better,Excellent experienceWorks well with Ipad Pro 11 inch (2022)Good battery lifeNo need to buy overpriced apple pencil,Brilliant product. Adds value to the iPad. Thankfully the alternative to otherwise expensive brand pencil.,Really a great product by king one ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. When i purchased the pencil I am doubt full about the quality of product but now a month I used it its amazing product by kingone and it\\'s no doubt best alternative for the apple pencil , even it supports wireless charging that\\'s make it amazing and battery is also to good . Osm product and I didn\\'t faces any ancidental power off as other pencils it\\'s cool and automatic swich off in it\\'s idel time save battery it like all rounder I can made a note and draw the paintings and so many other things .I am a student it\\'s saves moeny it\\'s best in one forth price of original one Cool......,Great quality with noags,For all those who can not afford the Apple Pencil, this one is a real problem solver. Its a little hard to get used to the pencil but works like a charm. zero issues. Lovely product,Initially I was sceptical using this pencil, because it kept skipping lines and became unresponsive. But after a while it became as smooth as original. You must go for it if pressure sensitivity is not what you are looking for. With wireless charging and button shortcuts it’s the best budget pencil. I will update my review to 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ after using and testing it for a while if it passes all the criterion. Thankyou. The sound quality of this earphone are really good. The bass part was also good. I only found the noise cancellation was not what I expected. It could be much better. Finally, I can say its a good value for money.,At this purchase, i did\\'nt received head phone pouch to keep my head phones safe... it disappointed me,overall good and decent quality, I am writing this after two months, I dont use regularly but whenever I use my colleagues says that your voice is clear 😂,Pin that I do connect to the phone gets automatically to outside. It doesn\\'t work. Plz amazon help me. I\\'m a regular customer of this company. I\\'ll be really thankful to you.,Great sound quality and good bass. Decent noise cancellation. I couldn\\'t have asked for  better earphones at this price.,Best for gaming,Good,Nice product Bought it in January,posting it in August. So i\\'ve used it almost 6 months and giving honest review.In short if you are getting it during sale time @899-999,then it\\'s a steal deal..also in regular price b/w 1299-1499 it\\'s a good product..Sound quality is good. Enough loud at 50-60% volume. Bass is also ok. Whenever needed it produces punchy bass. Overall balanced.Mic quality is good in indoor condition,but in noisy environment you can\\'t rely on this. Recevier can\\'t clearly listen to you.You can do gaming as company claiming low latency,i myself didn\\'t test it.Now about battery backup,company claim it will give battery backup of 42 hours with case. 6 hours in single charge+Additional 36 hours(6 times charge via case). But in practical use it gives total 35 hours playback. It will give around 5 hours backup on single charge of buds @ 50-60% volume(if you only listen to music or watching video,but no call or gaming) You can charge the earbuds full 6 times via case: so additional 30 hours.Just one issue with it\\'s design,suit case type box & not easy to carry in pocket. I would say it\\'s a personal preference. If you are into good looks,design then it\\'s not for you.Now it\\'s regular pricing varries between Rs 1299-1499. In this price range also it is one of the best tws under 1500. I will tell why.. now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under 1500. Most of them sound almost similar, difference is like 19/20!! They are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup & by youtubers,reviewers. 48/50 hours of playtime is just myth. I\\'ve personally used Truke(Airbuds lite,Buds F1) which is by far the most false promising brand claiming 48 hours of battery in their every tws,but only give 21 hours. Even other tws of boat(Airdopes 121 pro) which claim 40-45 hours playback only give around 25 hours,Defy Gravity Z claiming 50 hours only give 28 hours. If you are impressed by their looks & huge battery backup and thinking to buy those,you will be disappointed after purchase. Instead go with this,you will not be disappointed.,I read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like PUBG and also it falls from ear while running. And that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differenceBut a PUBG youtuber Recommended me this so I decided to give it a try, after trying out myself.Let me provide the facts for youI have a boat rockerz 510 headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing 2x better in providing accurate sound in PUBG.It’s been 2-3 days I used it daily for 6-7 hours on full charge, it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in PUBG it doesn’t give delay as written in the comments, it has a good latency better than what I had expected from the negative comments.Sometimes though I faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because it’s either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faq/guide/help card in the box I’m satisfied in terms of gaming.For sports like running I wouldn’t recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that it’s safe from landing on the ground I’m gonna try that, please don’t use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environment.,Pros:1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you\\'re at the gym, these are perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won\\'t be able to hear things around u very well, it\\'s great for places like Gym.4. Lovely battery life, I\\'ve had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you\\'ll be getting battery for a long long while.5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. Affordable!7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. Type C portCons:1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it\\'s great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won\\'t get the most crisp audio.2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it\\'s now a very frequent issue]3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it\\'s just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I\\'m very very happy with themHighly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc. 2 months review- its been working fine, there\\'s been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn\\'t basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it could\\'ve been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, I\\'ll give it 9/10, it\\'s good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven\\'t understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i can\\'t check prove if that\\'s correct.the water resistance, I haven\\'t used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch 😗,I\\'ve used this product for 4 days, and i\\'m going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -So, Bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don\\'t get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you can\\'t silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it\\'s almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you\\'ve a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It\\'s a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super 👍. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn\\'t have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn\\'t an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that\\'s what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It\\'s good value for money smart watch.Light weight. Touch is smooth.All the features are 90-95% accurate.,a good product in this price range must buy itGOOD LOOKINGGOOD QUALITY,Good product is mst h,Average for calling good looking,I\\'m really happy to purchase this watch! It\\'s very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well! Overall, if you\\'re looking so good brand & good features, go for this ..,Product does not turn onPlease return the item. Please. Very chip very good,Really happy to buy this pen drive comparatively with low cost,Very good,Storage capacity is good,Like,good,Good product and value for money,It\\'s all good , you can vo for it. Hi guys! Bought this yesterday, so haven’t used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It\\'s plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it\\'s weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn\\'t feel cheap at all, though I believe it could\\'ve been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn\\'t leave fingerprints on it, though if you\\'re someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it\\'ll show the oil prints and that\\'s true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn\\'t feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that\\'s a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it\\'s own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop\\'s bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you\\'re stuck and I don\\'t think you get only the dongle (you\\'ll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn\\'t have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook\\'s Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You\\'ll have to get used to that thing. It doesn\\'t feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn\\'t jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can\\'t complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it\\'s own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn\\'t bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.,The quality of power button is very low easily it can break,Nice Product, works as expected as of now no issues,Good,Very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.There\\'s a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons (right/left clicks)It will not bother most of you, I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things, So...[Personally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, (click click click)]Battery life of Logitech is known to be very good.,Quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price.,good product on which you can use for long time,This is good mouse, thanks to Amazon for providing this product at reasonable price. Very sharp and correct working mouse. The product is a good one, however once i received one with a small bump and I replaced it to receive one which won\\'t erase one part of the screen.The product is very handy and easy to use. However you would have to replace a couple of times to receive a good condition product.,Easy to use and since we bought it a two weeks before .,..good experience until now.,..I will review more after using it for atleast two months!,It\\'s fun with sustainable learning for kids. I ordered two tablets for my twins and both are liking it.,At first delete button was not worked so I thought the product Is damaged but there is lockscreen button on backside and its locked 🙃 overall good product thank you amazon,So far so good , a good alternative for paper  it works fine ... let\\'s see how long it will last .,Nice for kids to play with,Nice,Awesome my son like it very much Sound quality is good,enough loud at 50-60% volume. Bass is also ok. Mic quality is also good in indoor condition. Receiver can clearly listen to you. I didn\\'t use it in noisy environment or in outdoors. Company claims there is low latency while gaming,i don\\'t know exactly if it works or not. Sound & call quality wise it\\'s good one..But the problem is with battery backup. Company claim it will give battery backup of 40 hours with case. 8 hours in single charge+Additional 32 hours(4 times charge via case) This is misleading. It only gives total 25 hours playback. I\\'ve tested it myself.It will give around 7 hours backup on single charge of buds @ 50-60% volume(if you only listen to music or watching video,but no call or gaming) You can charge the earbuds full only 2.5 times via case: so additional 18 hours. If you try to charge after 2nd time it will only charge the buds around 60%,then it goes off. (After 1st charge the case has 48% battery left,2nd time it is down to 12%,then 3 rd time it goes to 0%)They mentioned earbuds have 40 mah battery each,380 mah battery in case. It is mentioned in product manual,but in boat website it is written 400 mah instead of 380.Technically 40 hours backup is also not possible.It has 380 mah battery in case,it acts like a 380mah powerbank. So let assume it\\'s efficiency is 60%. So it will give output of 228 mah.(It is less than mentioned capacity due to energy loss  while energy transfer) Now each earbud has 40 mah,so total 80 mah. Now buds can be charged via case 228÷80=2.85 times.That\\'s it.,Having bought this for roughly ₹1300, I must say that I\\'m not too satisfied with the product in many ways.1. Pairing is very simple and it connects very quickly.2. The build quality is actually very good. It\\'s all plastic but it looks quite durable as long as you\\'re not too rough with it.3. Audio is decent, not too impressive. My wired earphones (Boat Bassheads) are quite frankly much better.4. THIS IS NOT FOR GAMING. I play Call of Duty: Mobile and the latency is just painful. Even with \"Beast Mode\" turned on, I felt no difference as the the lag still persisted.5. The battery backup is actually great. The only positive thing I can think of is the battery backup. I got roughly 3 hours of playtime and the battery had drained from 100% to 80%. The quick charge is a cherry on top.Overall, I\\'d say it\\'s performance is very average. Definitely not worth ₹1300 in my opinion.,,Not adaptive for every person\\'s ear. My wife doesn\\'t suit the ear airdopes.  Partially satisfied. 799/- rupees i bought. Don\\'t bought more than 799 for this model.,The product was as good as i expected . The quality is good . Noise cancellation isnt quite high but overall good.,Battery lifespan i more, better audio. But calls are not audible properly some times.,It works best for the price. Sound quality is good, but plastic quality is average.,No clear sound on call. Creating disturbance during call It\\'s light weight, good looking. Stability is moderate. I got it for 399/- I hope it the price to be less that i bought. Overall Nice experience to have this beautiful table.,It\\'s a good product but ut has few marks on it which is not going away even after cleaning. It\\'s okay for me. Overall It\\'s good. Also because my laptop is 15.6\" display it takes up most of the space.,Table is of light weight and hope so its sturdy. Finishing is good with cup and mobile holder, will recommend this for kids writing purpose.,Worth for money. Useful for the one who wants to sit straight without bending spinal. For  WFH  perfect.,Keeps falling even at a slight push/touch. Unsafe to keep laptop. But very GOOD product if your base/floor is plain,Brought it for 399 rs, look wise its fab, very light weight,bottle doesn\\'t fits in slot.received damaged at corner s, connectors material is foam , due to it stability decrease. Mobile stand is not adhered. And packaging is worst no bubble paper no plastic wrapping present.Its ok okish product at this point of price.You can buy coz in market you get this beyond 600 rs.,Good for 📝 Students & laptop 💻 work.But not enough strong to lift heavy-weight items. Stability is also well.,Product is good and quality of table.i like this.... 128GB SD Card is showing 134GBDon\\'t buy this product,It was a bit costly but prouduct is of great quality. Could have been made little bit cheaper cost wise.,All good,Fast and smooth,Ab mujhe computer ki jarurat nahi padti,Speed is fast but not as advertise I get around read speed 70MB/s and write speed 30MB/s,Good one,Product is ok. Touch screen functions well .step counting is not that much accurate, heart beat sensor is quite accurate but i think spo2 and stress measurement are not that much accurate,The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there\\'s not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.The watch is not very intuitive to use. It\\'s usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.Sleep tracking is decent.Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is goodAlso, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?,What i need in watch is not available so don\\'t need this...can get it in normal watch from other brands,Look and feel is awesome. This is great product suggestions from Amazon. Thanks,I like the step count and heart rate accuracy. Not sure about stress count sometimes it shows inaccurate.,Bluetooth connectivity needs to be improve and touch also,All ok, but anti scratch glass required in this watch,Good watch go for it Writing this review after 10 months of usage. First about the product itself.  It\\'s sound quality is very good. Bass lovers will just love it. Average mids and high.  It lasts about 25-28 hrs with a full charge. Also tested on heavy rain while driving ( don\\'t worry , earphones were not plugged in.. 😂). It was on my neck. But there was no water ingress.Now the major problem kicks in . After 10 months left speaker was not working. So , I registered a complaint on boat website. They picked my earphone for replacement.  But later it was replaced with \" rockerz 255 pro \" instead of \" rockerz 255 pro + \" . Why ? Even after a lot of conversations with boat support they didn\\'t provide me my model . Now I\\'ve to stick with these low quality ear peace. Hence ,Try to avoid boat online support for warranty claim and better visit physical service entre. Good luck.Edit : After having conversation with higher authorities on Twitter, they replaced the same with my model .Edit 2 : from first day onwards after receiving the replacement product I was in doubt that the sound quality was decreased a lot. So, again I replaced with the authorized service centre for flat ( no/ very low bass)  sound.  But the 2nd replacement is also same. I thought I\\'ve some issues with my ear lol 😆 . But today when I listened to my friends rockerz 255 pro + (same as mine but the retail unit) I was surprised and thankful too . My ear was not damaged . It had the same punchy bass and that signature sound which was absent from my replacement unit.So, I can conclude by saying the replacement product will not have that signature sound as the retail unit.If anybody has experienced the same please comment.Thanks,I would recommend it very strongly if you want a budget friendly gaming earphone sometimes may feel a lag after purchasing but after some time it works very fine but it also has some cons like the build quality my earbuds gone worn off by normal daily use as well as there rubber quality is not that much good also mic it is not that good but it is okay so it is the best earphone under your budget....If aman gupta is watching this review you may gift me a earphone 😉😅,thanks to amazon for such good deliverance of the products,, i have been using amazon for long time and amazon have truely win the trust of the customer. Great product and once agian,, thanks to amazon,Charging back up is awesome25th December morning ko recive hua thn 30 December k night m charging finish huibut mene first time charge kiya to 2hrs se b zyada time m 100℅ charge hua,The product fits snugly in the ears. There is some pain after prolonged use for the first 2 weeks or so of using.Battery lasts over a day after full charge for an average user.Volume is strong, and so is the bass. Sound clarity is average.Product is sturdy enough to use comfortably without worry of damage.,Very good for sound, noise cancellation & battery backup. only fins have pain in ears sometimes, otherwise its really value for money.,Dear sir,I purchased this bluetooth on April 24th 2022.But from August 2022 onwards not working,also continuously iam trying to ask many shops for service at my place - Tiruchirapaalli,but no body doing blue tooth service.Also boat rockers blue tooth having very less number of days warranty only.Now what can I do? Please suggest.If possible, please collect my bluetooth from your delivery person and do the best.,compared to my previous neckband which was realme buds wireless neo. this is very good quality sound and form factor and finish also is nice The Product is useful and i use it daily. I gave a 1 star less because product had a small piece broken while delivery maybe. But that was not a functional part though.,The material can be bit more thick for durability. Overall a good buy.,The only issue is stability.... It do shakes,Stability should have been better.,Product is very fine in all aspects except in cost. Cost could have been less,Very good product in this price.,Nice product,Good When you are representing some product from a well known brand you must provide that well known build quality.This product is designed well to grab the good looks but not the quality of the material, it seems to be bad quality will not last in the longer run.Reason: I had just started using it to hear 3 or 4 songs with in that time 3MM Jack end rubber seems to be started braking.I feel that I can better quality on the platform vendors for this price.,Using this earphones almost for 6 months average sound quality performance is good bass quality average overall product is good 👍 and value for money 💰 if your looking for long term use go for it,just 150 buck i got it look wise fine. during a unboxing time i notice it broken and i try easily to fit it so i dont want to replace/ return it because only 150rs and easily fix.,Good product, Sound comes smoothly in 50- 70 volume level.,Ok,Super,Is better is not button,its very good at this price; ... I need one more, will plan to buy again, during offer @129/; The quality is not upto mark for the price paid. Other brands offer good quality earphones with lesser price. But per my experience none of my earphones have lasted more than 1-1.5 years.Given that this is JBL, lets see how long it lasts.Can someone build a earphone which lasts couple of years? I\\'ll buy :),I had purchased two units of same headset of which one was found to be defective. Since I was on travel I couldn\\'t check the items immediately and by time I found item to be defective the return/ replacement window has elapsed.,Build Quality is average considering JBL a global brand providing u an amazing sounding earphone under 700. Highly recommended if u r a music lover.,Sound quality is awesome but not bassMic is below averageIt come out from ears if you walk fastNot for game you can\\'t hear footsteps of enemyReview after use of 4,5 earphones (c100si) 2 year experience,Awesome product....but resolve its tangling issue please otherwise nice product,Nice,After 8 months, left side speaker has no bass and not as loud as the right speaker.,Superb voice quality Best budget headphones. I\\'m procured this headphones in 2021and now is 2023 when I\\'m writing. It has some prominent problems first is head adjustments get losse after 1 year and after one and half year cushions get also strat rip off thereof  third initally battery was awesome i remember that I used to use my headphone 2 week in singal charge even whereas It always left connected over the night and start useing after wake up. It\\'s my  tendency, I don\\'t endow rest to devices notwithstanding this it\\'s is still alive and working as before but now it works 1 week in singal charge.,,It\\'s a good product but now days many brands offer better than this at tha price range.,It\\'s a nice product. Mic quality is also good. Battery back up is good.,Best part of the headphone is the battery backup..its huge.i love this product,but if it built to be a overhead,Thank you boult,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/61D4cZxo9aL._SY88.jpg,Good Product of boAt The watch works fine. Good touch screen and overall features. But the connectivity with smartphone is pathetic. If you prefer a smartwatch which is not intended to pair with you phone then go for it. It works well in all other aspects.,This was indeed an ideal purchase. Good performance, good built, up to the mark functionality at this price. Stable and Sturdy. Recommend. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,Looks ok,हार्ट रेट एवं ऑक्सीजन,Good for normal users.....Not for heavy users like daily activities.....Good looking on hand...App is not working properly some times,The battery power is amazing 👍🏻,It\\'s a good watch but the strap always comes out,Nice watch It has been only 1 month since I have bought this item so I can\\'t comment on its durability but currently it is working perfectly. Sound quality is good. Fitting in ear is perfect which has been constantly an issue with other earphones I have used till now.I have doubt on its durability because its wires are kind of handle-with-care. If it is durable then it will be among one of the best earphones, I have used till now.,Unable to hear after, 8 months,Good budget earphones for taking call and listening to music/ watching videos once in a while. Be careful with the wire though as it can get tangled easily and is not that strong.,Best buying in these range,The C50 HI is a budget friendly in ear earphone and it really comes at a great price.But the next version of these i.e. C100SI has more value for money factors.Like C50 HI has angled 3.5mm jack whereas C100SI has the normal one and i am not supposed to say this but trust me C100SI has the best best best and superior sound quality if I compared to C50HI.Though it doesn\\'t have a great durability.But if your previous earphones were c100si and you are switching on these then one can definitely notice the difference between the c100si and c50hi although you can adapt the sound of c50hi in nearly about 1 week if you are switching from c100si.To be honest the c100si is literally best in all circumstances such like gaming,Listening to music and professional editing the vocals,mids highs lows are perfectly balanced in c100si but not c50hi.in c50hi mostly when listening to sing the bass was not up to mark and the vocals were so loud that the bass was literally fading main point is that whenever we hit the full volume both of them never distorted any single beat.Hat\\'s off to harman.,Good earphones short time usage.,Its good with very clear voice and average Bass clarity. I am not giving 5 stars because certain Bass can be improved a bit more. Overall its a good one.,Was looking for budget earphones with voice clarity, JBLC50 HI does the work. Except for bass quality there nothing else to complain about. Ordered this product for charging cables. The package involved 3 packs containing 4 spirals. However, they sent all the packs containing same 4 colours. The spirals are tight for thick cables but loose for apple\\'s charging cables as they very thin.,very useful product but the grip and the size of it was a bit small for my cable as it couldn\\'t fully cover the entire part of it but nonetheless it\\'s gonna work and im glad i have it as a safety for my data cable. good product.,Good product,If u have a single charger and it’s expensive too then u should try this…. It really protect ur wires,Good,Good product, value for money,It\\'s nice but thoda length or ho sakti h size thoda chota h,Best product for usb and other cables Had used Ptron earphones earlier. So wanted to tried this one. And it\\'s good,Newly purchased. Not yet used. But looks good and worth for money,Charging well but build quality could be better,Quite nice,this product working fine....,Ok ok,Good Purchase for 300 Rs , its has 1 type C and 2 Regular Ports for Charging with Good Speed and Also Looks Good,While it\\'s priced very economical the built quality could have been better given the brand Got 2 of this 32GB HP v236w pendrives this morning. Review is based on testing done the same day:Summary:The product is genuine and sturdy, but the performance is just about average, based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire space.Pros & Cons (comparing with SanDisk Cruiser Blade 32 GB) :Pros-1. Solid body, looks and feels great.2. Read speed is fine (22 MB/s).3. Product is genuine, covered under 2 Year manufacturer warranty.Cons -1. Fits too tight in usb port, thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully.2. Capacity is 31 GB (precisely 31042043904 bytes), not 32 as advertised. In windows it\\'ll show up as a 28.9 GB drive compared to 29.8 in Sandisk. No big deal, just a technical observation.3. Write speed (3.3 MB/s) is not bad, but slightly inferior to its close competitor Sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives 4 to 4.4 MB/s for the same test.4. Warranty is only 2 years, compared to 5 years on Sandisk. But since almost nobody claims warranty after 2 years, and besides- the plastic body of Sandisk gets physically damaged in 2 years anyway, so it\\'s okay for me.Bottomline:It\\'s good enough for casual users, maybe chosen over Sandisk for its look, feel and sturdiness. Frequent users may want to look for better options- with easier port fitting and better write speed.Details:The product name is HP v236w as shown on its packing (the images in listing are correct) while its part number is FD236W-32, so slightly confusing but both are the same thing.Testing whether it is genuine or fake:The bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with \"scratch and check\" written on it. Scratching it reveals a 20-digit code beneath it, and the right edge of the sticker has the url \"www.pny.com.tw\" to verify this code. Go to support > product authentication page on that url. That page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get. Mine were originals, with the codes tested for the first time (repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested before).So that means it is covered under 2 year manufacturer warranty, as declared by hp for Aisa Pacific region.Design and build quality : Sturdy, stylish but with a design flaw-It is exactly as shown in the picture. The body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap. The plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look, though it may come off later. The HP logo, product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely won\\'t be erased with time. Overall, it looks and feels great. The flaw I noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port, compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like Sandisk. You almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out. This means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon, or may even break it if not used carefully.Capacity : 31 GB, not 32, will appear as 28.9 GB in windows-It is advertised as a 32 GB drive but the actual capacity is 31GB, and yes, I\\'m fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference, I\\'m a hardcore linux user. To be precise, its exact capacity is 31042043904 bytes (on both pendrives I tested). So in windows it will show up as a 28.9 GB drive. In linux it will show up as either 31 GB, or 28.9 GiB (binary calculation like windows). For comparison, my 32GB Sandisk shows up as 32010928128 bytes, or 32 GB, or 29.8 GiB. This loss of 1 GB in a 32GB pendrive is no big deal for me, just a technical observation.Performance:Read speed: about 20-22 MB/sWrite speed: about 3.3 MB/sTested with : a collection of ISO files ranging from about 350MB to 4GB, along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt. Total size of the collection was about 30.2 GB (28.2 GiB).I did this testing on linux, so to be fair, the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat32 that the pendrive comes formatted as.(Edit: No performance difference on Windows either. Formatted as exFAT on windows 10 to make it multiboot with YUMI. Read-write speeds were same while copying ISO files to it, or reading them to load in memdisk while booting.)I could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didn\\'t bother as the difference usually isn\\'t very significant.,Ups.....The product is very good, i mistakenly washed it 8n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new. No data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yet.Downs......The only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology 2.0(3.2 is newer one)And second one is not affact your data at all.. the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning black,Product is good but slow,Storage is good but doesn’t work for car stereo,57 GB OUT OF 64,So far so good,Good product,Ok The mouse is decent for its price of 269I don\\'t usually use Windows I\\'m using this on my Linux OS and its works fine on Arch Linux so I\\'m sure it will work fine on any Debian-based distro as well.First impression - The size is a bit smaller so it will take time to get used to it The scroll wheel is little wobbly Buttons travel of the button is bit too much considering its small form factor*I will update my review after using it*,I have been searching for this kind of small mouse which is very handy to use. Value for money.,Just good as in this price range,This is nice product in low cost.,Given price, Better one definitely.,Little one,Overall good product,Its easy to use. Light weight. Easy to hold. Clicks are a little hard. Sleep mode fine - there\\'s a switch on the back. Just remember this is not a silent mouse, and will make loud click sounds.,worthy easy to handle,Product is completely satisfied from Portronics. I never thought that this company would be near to hp or Dell if we talk about computer peripherals, but portronics changed my thinking. I appreciate this.Mouse is good and working smoothly.,Value for Money,Good Pricing, Light Weight and Excellent Functionality. Sleep mode is Good. Should be used with Duracell...,Pros:1. Design is good, small and comfortable to use.2. Sleep mode is very effective. Can save battery.Cons:1. If your mouse in bag and you turn on your PC it will get connected and stay on if clicks are happening due to movement inside bag.2. Not that much silent clicks. HP mouse was better.3. Even with this effective sleep mode. Its battery gets drained too fast.Conclusion: Its good for use and for money. But if you\\'re working professional i would suggest buy an rechargable Mouse. Can save your spends on AA battery and your ways to shop.,nice product,Its have on off switch for saving battery life. and product is fine according to price Battery life is low,Worth purchase,Good performance at this price range,A economical product to buy for average usage of checking time, heart monitoring, steps track, etc.Battery backup great single charge stands for min 3 days.Recommended only for simple use and show off.,First of all, this watch is budget friendly.watch faces - the app has a large number of watch faces step track - not that accurate but that fine• weather forecast:- 100% accuratesleep - pretty accurate information Overall, the experience is pretty good.But but but, The battery life is not that good only 4 days of battery backup.,Nice product,Overall good product to buy,Good product Its only 4 days since we are using the product and based on so far usage, review is as below :PROS :1) Looks, it looks premium.2) Features at this price range3) Battery : It seems as if the battery will easily last for a week or more with normal usage ( Have closed all notifications which saves battery )4) Steps Accuracy : Will give 8 out of 105) Magnetic charger ( easy to charge )CONS :1) Have not noticed anything till now.,I ordered 2 watches for my wife and sister. Got it at the price of 1500. I am always a fan of Firebolt. And ninja 3 is very good. Touch responce is good. Good battery life. Sleep track is very occuracy. It has all necessary features and those are quite accurate. It\\'s light weight and looks good. Over all it\\'s an excellent product at this price.,Touch screen is not so good it takes time may be i need to use it for a while for better experience,I like the sleep tacking , heartbeat measuring , Spo2 and exercise tracking .I dislike the bluetooth of the smart watch only .  I use this watch for exercises,Battery is goodTouch screen is niceAll fixtures are very good,I like the watch style and charging is so fast,Firebolt Ninja 3Felt Good  for the watch , simple and easy,Its good, value for money, overall performance is good. This is my first product from Boult. I wanted a wired earphone and when I searched on Amazon I found Boult in such a low price and I ordered it. Recieved it today.Checked it by connecting to my phone and I was surprised by the audio quality. This is a nice product in this price range and the mic is also good. The build quality is average and you can\\'t complain considering the price. It also has a clip to attach the earphone to your shirt like the good old Nokia days. It has total 3 pair or ear tips (2 in a zipper packet and 1 already attached to the earphone).  The manufacturing date is March 2022. So, it\\'s quite new actually, not an old stock. It also has that anti-slip ear hook, which is an added advantage. In general, it is a good product for this price.,I was looking for reliable Bluetooth earbuds on a budget, and settled on these. Personally, I am pleased with them. I have been using them for almost four months now, including one month when they saw around 12 hours of use per day.PROS:▪ Comfortable.▪ Elegant and sober appearance.▪ Reasonable battery life. I would let the earbuds recharge at, for example, mealtimes.▪ Decent range. Going a few meters into the next room, with a concrete wall in between, was no issue.▪ The battery status of the dock is shown by a series of LED blinks. Simple and practical.CONS:▪ Mediocre phone calling quality. In particular, the microphone. The few conversations I had using these went successfully, so this was not a deal breaker, but the clarity was not the best for sure.The touch controls were initially a drawback for me, but I got used to them. Also, this product does not come with a charger. Either charge off of your computer, or buy a charger with the recommended electrical output. As for the sound quality, it is acceptable, not superlative. I have listened to music, and I have watched films and YouTube videos, with no problem.As a final note, I prefer this type of earbud over the in-ear type, because I find it more hygienic. Wiping with a clean cloth after each use, and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time, should help to slow fungal growth.,Very Good Product, nicely fits in the ear and comfortable .The Volume seems to be a little low at the highest.But, A good Buy,Sound quality is good everything is balanced but bass dominance is too high and couldn\\'t hear the treble and other notes,very good bass quality And Worth for money earphones I ever Buy.. also Product Quality is awesome 🔥❤️,it doesn\\'t fit as snugly in my ears, maybe it is cause of greasy ears, but the product is good, highly recommended,,Bolte audio bass is very good Ordered it for my home office and have been using this for almost 10 months, it looks good and there is no lag in typing and the keys are comfortable while typing.,Nic product and smooth keyboard! Effortless typing and keys are aligned exactly as per my expectations. Not happy with the packaging and I hope realises from next order.,Felt happy to see Dell on its body; I think it is genuine. it worked from day one; future will tell how long it satisfies me. \\'am using it with an old laptop.,Good for typing, and working very smoothly...,Good p,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71clegoImjL._SY88.jpg,Good product,good Received the product today. The packing was intact though I found watch not at its proper place. It fell down inside the box and found the inner holding box damaged also. Not expecting any kind of tampering but thought to share the product packaging. Overall nice product, will share detailed review once use it for atleast a week.,Good watch through fire 🔥 boultI am impressed for this watch is so computableand all features are properly working like mean feature voice calling are properly working andThis price range are no any brand are give this feature I am Happy for this watchThank you Fire 🔥 boult,Pros: The phone supports both phone and apps calling. Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It was a awesome watch... I liked it sleep monitoring it\\'s accurate. According to me this worth buying and I would suggest anyone who is reading this review to go ahead and buy this watch,It\\'s good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it\\'s better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it\\'s close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it\\'s a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged. One feedback to supplier to improve the glass of watch, there are lots of scratches within one month of usage. I\\'m using this mouse from more than 6 months now and It\\'s working great.but the only problem I faced is the big size of it.It looks like the old ball mouse which is quite big in size.Good for gaming by the way.,Working good,by far the best mouse I\\'ve used (writing this after 3 days). suits well for daily use; could be a tad bit bigger ...,Been using this mouse for the last 4 years both in office and at home. Suits my hand the best, tried some gaming mouse at 500-800 range but the feel is not good and my wrist starts to hurt on those cheap mice. This one is the father of all mice in that sense as it ticks all the boxes for me. Obviously you cant expect some god like gaming performance but its decent and for everything else it\\'s the best.,Item is good.  No issues,It\\'s Really worthwhile,A bit short in height, clicks and scroll good for home and office use,Easy to use. Rough. Lasts for 4 years+. Affordable. NOTE :@ Its ready to go Mic, which doesn\\'t need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones.* Has 3.5mm jack connector built in, you can use 1/4\\' connector if needed.@ It has very Long cable which measures upto 20 feet, so note that.@ It has absolutely NO noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in STOCK condition, but with SIMPLE EDITING this mic works just fine ( Check the review below for detailed settings )There are literally thousands of review on this product, but NONE explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with Audacity software, or even in general. So I took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box, as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones. So I went to search for best settings on amazon & other sources but in vain. Fortunately I myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine.First I am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that I found and then listing those settings,PROS :-------1. Built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given.2. Length of cable is insane (20 feet).* I personally didn\\'t find it useful, as I use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets, but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with Camera.3. Has universal 3.5mm jack, which is handy.4. Its easy to use, just plug and play device, which doesn\\'t need any sound card or external device to work.5. Has support for multiple device right from smartphones to DSLRs and computers.6. It comes with carry pouch which is very handy, since its a mess with such long cables.CONS :--------1. Biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box. Its just garbage quality and even normal ears can\\'t bear the background noise collection, so forget about audiophiles. My normal smartphone\\'s earphones record much better sound quality compared to this.2. Length of cable is way too much for me and I guess for many users. I think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from, as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable.3. It comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and there\\'s NO way to know whether the battery is dead or what\\'s its charging level. Only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test. So if you are carrying it with recorder which doesn\\'t has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound, then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me, its very frustrating ! I am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence I am very cautious about batteries now & use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. I think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.BEST SETTING USING AUDACITY SOFTWARE :===================================These are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use Audacity software, which is Free !1. Open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. Select entire audio clip and open \"Effects\" and then \" DISTORTION \"3. Start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.Now select \" Distortion Type \" option on the top of box and select \" Soft Clipping \".* or select \" Hard Limiter \" and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. Take the \"Clipping Level cursor to extreme Right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. Adjust the \"Make-up Gain\" cursor little bit if needed, I keep it on 49.* Here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. Now just click \" APPLY \".8. Now is Noise reduction. For that Select short section of audio which DOES NOT have your voice, but ONLY has background noises that you don\\'t want.9. Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \"10. Click on \" Get Noise Profile\".11. Now select entire audio clip and again Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \".12. Finally, click on \" OK \" and that\\'s it !Now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser Noises and more pleasant sound output. After these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.VERDICT :-----------I personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. Plus price seems slightly more on this. I wouldn\\'t recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. Buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,It\\'s not great or best out there for beginners but good-I use a budget mid-range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it in WAV format, it\\'s good.-You gotta use software/apps to pull the best of this, like audacity or some other editing app.-It\\'s pretty long and that\\'s good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripod.-Overall it\\'s decent for beginners. I see high-end phones have good recording capabilities, but if you have a budget phone, then this one is deal.,Microphone looks very well built, it supports both phones and cameras. There are some phones that does not support external mic, please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it.They claim noise cancellation, however, I did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise, only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone. I could not observe noise cancellation, at least, while recording on phone.Overall package is well bundled, wire quality is decent, however the dongle quality is excellent, even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid.,Wire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then 5 stars from me but now 4 star good sound low price 1 star - for wire quality but over all a nice product.☆☆☆☆,I think It\\'s good for online teaching like I do...But yeah some problems like very long cable length I mean someone might need but it should be optional.... or detachable price of the Mic itself is not much anywaysI am okay with this mic for sometime... until I am sure I need quality Rode mic to upgrade...,Don\\'t expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very good.,Nice product,Decent Looks durable Charging is fine tooNo complains,Charging is really fast, good product.,Till now satisfied with the quality.,This is a good product . The charging speed is slower than the original iPhone cable,Good quality, would recommend,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/81---F1ZgHL._SY88.jpg,Product had worked well till date and was having no issue.Cable is also sturdy enough...Have asked for replacement and company is doing the same...,Value for money Nice one, tried on remote mouse and found working fine.,Good product, good services.,V good,As described Duracell battery good one,For AC Remotes,The life on these is excellent, been using these for my controllers for gaming and these are the best. Lasts long and does its job. What else do you need.,Good Quality,Loved the product Very nice ball pen,Thank you Amazon,Easy to hold but not water resistant. Can say value for money,Kids like the colours and are very fond of writing with it,The product is good, and my son likes it.....,Loved the product, very smooth and apt colour of inkMust go product,It\\'s writing like flowing silk.,buy...... Quality of adhesive is very good. I used it to stick photo canvas on wall and it worked well.,Good kwality,i dont tell this product totally good.but i believe this item 75 % good.,Good product,Holds good on walls but not in wood works .,Sticks well.. Holds fair amount of weight..,Good and usefull,Very nice. Recieved damaged product the first time, the seller is very good and quickly replaced it for a new one. Go for bassheads 242 if you are spending this much. They are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable. The angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is so-so. Infinity zip 100 and their own bassheads 242 are way better for sound.,I would like to start by saying I\\'m not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, it\\'s good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be!Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later.Coming to the ear phones itself, it\\'s among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these.The wire itself is made of rubber/silicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn\\'t showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal? Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I don\\'t know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn\\'t affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it won\\'t blow anyone\\'s mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I won\\'t be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half it\\'s total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in let\\'s say the newer Bose ear phones aren\\'t as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros:1) No metal build2) Excellent wire quality and trendy3) Durable4) Above average sound qualityCons:1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh,Best quality  I like boat earphone saund quality,Only disadvantage  I noticed was this can\\'t be use in USB phones,  3.5 mm jack is provided so it can be  usedin Jack phones only .,Nice,good,I used this headphone for travel. Very lite and easy to carry in pocket. colourful. Sound quality is good. The wire is thin so i feel cautious  While taking it from bag or pocket.,Gd one! Only thing is covers/sleeves comes out easily if not gd fit. However, additional covers/sleeves are provided. Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it\\'s a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn\\'t look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don\\'t find it good enough if I compare it with Boat\\'s App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band. The sound quality is amazing but you have to be very careful while using it as the wire from the earplugs to the controller seems very delicate. One negative point is that the noise cancellation sucks.,Great bass and noice overall awesome and build quality is very slick,👍,It\\'s obviously not the best earphone out there but certainly does it\\'s job for the price, you won\\'t miss out on much just a bit of bassGreat buy though,Value for money. Decent build quality and looks. Best product at this price range.,Nice... Value of the product,I like this,It\\'s best quality and good 👍  for thi renge Writing this after using it for two months --Pros -1. Noiseless button2. Soft press3. Lightweight4. Good build quality5. Non-eraseable button sign6. Easy battery installation7. Good support range8. All button work properly9. All 104 buttons are available10. Low battery indicator (The indicator does not glow when you install the new battery. It glows only when the battery is low.)Cons -1. No num-lock light2. No caps-lock light3. No scroll-lock light,Works well for my basic usage.The keys travel is smooth and fine, and mose click and wheel is  not that smooth, but that is fine as this is the starting range. Perhap the next one is slightly more expensive, I guess that might be what I could have tried.,The keyboard is superb. The mouse too is nice. However the led light of the mouse isn’t working for the piece we have received. We Mable to give a 5 star rating because of this flaw.,Comes with Duracell Batteries so you can straight away plug it and play it.You have to keep the reciever really close to the keyboard and mouse, yet mouse constantly shows lag and skips during movement.,Good,Wireless keyboard and mouse combination made my desk clean,Great product from DELL, using for a long time and it is very comfortable for long hour working.,Good product but key spaces are larger than normal pc keyboard. I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it\\'s still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn\\'t ever thought that this cable will be so long it\\'s good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter\\'s old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can\\'t blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place. Not quite durable and sturdy,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71rIggrbUCL._SY88.jpg,Working good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61bKp9YO6wL._SY88.jpg,Product,Very nice product,Working well,It\\'s a really nice product 1. Please add app gallery when we do right to left swap on home screen. Because right to left swap or left to right swap have same pages.2. It should ring instead of vibrate in alarm or you can give it optional depends  on user.3. The temperature doesn\\'t sync fast I have to go in the noisefit app  again and again and do it on and off in weather settings to sync feels like jugad. All these things can be fix from updates so pls try to do it,The watch looks cool and works very well but the sensors are not the most accurate. It shows that I am up 1 to 1½ hour every night when I am not also the heart rate is generally higher than what it actually is and the calories burnt are lower, the pedometer is more or less accurate,Nice one. Only Bp monitor is missing.,I like this product,I liked the watch very much,DOes everything well so far,I m happy,Good features Good one.,gud,Hard disk is good but data cable quality poor,Finalised this product after a lot of research. It works well. Go for it.,Serve the purpose,Good one,Nice product,Still at work. The video is slight zoomed in, which is great for office work since you want it to focus on face rather than the rest of the background. However there is a slight tinge of sepia (warm temperature) in the picture quality/ hence reduced 1 star. Really cost effective!,Product helped me in my live classes,Yes,THIS PRODUCT IS AN AVERAGE PRODUCT. PICTURE QUALITY IS OK OK AND ALSO MIKE IS WORKING OK OK CALLER LISTENS TO YOUR VOICE NORMALLY. BUT ITS GOOD TO USE FOR THE OFFICE OR HOME FOR SKYPE CALLING OR ZOOM MEETINGS.,the picture quality is crap!! tbh,No mic,Quick setup, no downloads needed, built quality no complaints, picture quality just near average, mic quality ok, could be cheaper,It is good in daylight if you have window to for sunlight when you use it work better. In the night it start lagging (you need too much lighting in the night that may harm your eyes and start headache)I gave 4 bc of pricing but 3 star for camera quality. (Bcz not good in night) I have used it for week now on daily basis. It\\'s a good product.1.For normal use It\\'s great. You can use it with ease.2. For game 🎮  also it is usable but it\\'s littel bit on heavy side Its unnoticeable if you are not that habitable to play games.3 sleep mode is a good feature which helps to save battery 🔋. And you don\\'t have to worry about killing the switch whenever you leave the pc.,Nice product,Value for money,This mouse is very noisy and small too.I have returned this mouse because I got a better product of Quantum with keyboard which satisfies me.Also this mouse package doesn\\'t contain any battery.So, you should care and think twice before purchasing this product.,Nice product so far it working smooth,Good product at this price. But after falling down it gets broken.,Good for basic use not for gaming.,I like this product. Good product,long wire,Charges good,Nice,I bought this cable for Rs.339 worthy product for this price, i tested it in various charger adapters 33w and 18w it supports fast charging as well.,Good,Ok,I had got this at good price on sale on Amazon and product is useful with warranty but for warranty you need to go very far not practical for such a cost and mine micro to type c connector stopped working after few days only.,I like this product I am using this Product from last 12 days, and its working great.Keyboard:- Keys are really soft touch and almost soundless. It automatically goes in power saving mode with in 1m20sec when not in use.Mouse:- works smooth works almost on every surface .Fast-typers  can also use this product. - YES.Just that the material/plastic of the keyboard is expected within this price.,This model companion 102 Keyboard buttons are not as comparable /comfortable as other standard basic model availableHowever we need to  practice to get used to it .Overall it is ok for rough use , where we can avoid using laptop keyboard ..Keyboard requires AAA battery and mouse require AA battery.. it could have maintained same.. need to check battery life of keyboard.Mouse doesn\\'t come with on off button to save battery life.,Good,For the space I\\'m using, it\\'s good. One of the key came out then I\\'ve to replace. Now working well. But not dependable bcos if u r not careful...... when the next one comes out can\\'t say then it\\'s useless.,keyboard is excelent, but mouse quality is below average...but at that price a perfect choice.,good,Ok,Very good product I recently purchased a tripod online from Amazon and I am very pleased with the purchase. The product arrived quickly and was well packaged, making it easy to set up. The construction is solid and sturdy, allowing me to confidently use my camera without fear of any wobbling or shaking. In addition, the price was extremely affordable compared to similar products on other sites. Overall, I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for an inexpensive yet reliable tripod!,Product is good as expected, sturdy, light weight and good for beginnersThank you,Product is good and light weight.,I like it very much the product was amazing at affordable price it very useful and helpful for beginners,It is very easy to use and light weight to carry around. Great tool for clicking pictures on a scenic holiday.,It\\'s stability is perfect. Beginners can start with it👍,like the stability and mobile holder,Simply Superb this one for phones & cameras Everything is good as I\\'ve used like a lot of earbudss nd this one i found is quite ammusing.....like i didn\\'t get the nice range quality as in my device never cncts wid every wireless device..... but it connected wid my device nd it works swesome,After using the Bluetooth around one week i experience that call quality is average but you can use this to listen music if you are not base lover.,Bass quality is good can be better.,Overall it\\'s good but there is small disubence during driving  with in the range,Nice and good product. Liked it,SOUND IS GOOD BUT QUALITY NORMAL,Good product impressive,Sound nd bass is good nd value for money Bought this instead of original apple, does the work for 150rs, not as fast as apple charger but its a good option if you want cheap and good product, bought it for iPad pro 10.5 and it\\'s working flawlessly, build quality is ok, its not like i am gonna hang my clothes on it and i want a very strong cable, even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don\\'t buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it\\'s stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It’s good. Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money Initially the pendrive i got was getting very hot when inserted and without doing anything but then i applied for exchange and the second time i got a pendrive it just gets little bit warm and is much better than first time. I had called SanDisk for first pendrive and they asked me ask for replacement so i did and second time I\\'ve got good pendrive. Go for it.,Best quality and value for money,Working good,60 percent Good40 percent badHeating very fast because of the metal body I guess,kind of slowBuilt quality is good,Since it\\'s metal, the build quality is great but causes heating issue when transferring files for longer periods of time, otherwise performs as expected,It is best pendrive at this prize and speed is good. I suggest u can buy without any worry,The quality of pen drive is absolutely good as expected but yes as other customers mentioned in comments about the heating issue.. Yes it heats up but only when its actually in use.. means while transfers or hardcore use of pendrive but when left idle its completely normal. I forgot the pendrive attached until afternoon but it was completely normal.. No heating issue once the transfer was done.,Average ,Wow!!! Just wow!!! How can a beautiful product like this exist at such an affordable price?! I mean I am simply amazed by this watch. Kya dikhti hai yaar aur kya waqt dikhati hai yaar. Yeh ghadi tik-tik toh nahin chalti but it has made my life tracking theek-theek for sure since the day it is with me. I love this watch. The accuracy, colour (black), weight, apperance, etc. are so so so amazing.Giving 4 stars because its mobile app sucks for real. Mobile connectivity has a lot to be improvised. It could have been upto the mark agar ghadi banane pe itna kharcha kar hi diya hai toh :(,Nice product and user friendly compare to other smart watch.,Nice watch,Noise is best...it\\'s very useful product,I like,After 6 months the charging is not working,Good productI hv used this product since 1 year The selfie stick is made up of cheap quality plastic.However the built structure of the selfie stick is stable and even the tripod stand will provide you ample support to make a video  time lapse or a portrait selfie.Recommended to all video bloggers who have just started their channels on YouTube or any other sites.Its worth a product with the money we are paying to purchase it.,Did take this product on a trip. It\\'s good but I was always afraid whether it\\'s going to fell from the stand. The holder is clumpsy, cannot hold it tighter. Need another person help to insert the phone in the stand or need to sit down and stretch the phone holder to insert the phone. Maybe not worth 399₹. Let me know if you have any other doubts,It is user friendly,Product is good and light weight.,Works well and Bluetooth connectivity is also good.,Nice product.Bluetooth option Is good,Stability is ok only, otherwise a decent product,Good product As I browsed various multiple earphones in this range on a not-so-busy workday break, I came across this very feature-packed product. It seemed interesting - and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it + ANC. So I thought I\\'d give it a shot.First-day impressions - it\\'s blown me away!Exhaustive list of impressions:1. DIRAC OPTEO: Balanced sound with punchy bass! Yeah, and not booming bass. It\\'s so great and I\\'m quite surprised it sounds like something you\\'d expect at a higher price point.  1.1 Soundstage: As soon as the headphone is switched on, it starts in \\'battery saving mode\\'. Once you turn on DIRAC Opteo mode, you can literally feel the space opening up. All the instruments feel individual and sound separated. Fireflies (by Owl City) sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. It\\'s really great for the price!  1.2 Treble and Mids: Clean and clear. The bass doesn\\'t overpower them and feels just right. The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don\\'t interfere with it (Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great!).  1.3 Bass: Punchy and tight. I love how it fizzles in \\'Bonfire\\' (by Knife Party) and how it reverberates in \\'Turn Down for what\\' (by DJ Snake). \\'Breakin\\' a Sweat\\'(by Skrillex, Zedd) sounded tight and I discovered how well produced it is! Lovers of tight bass, this is your product!2. Volume: It gets really loud. So loud that I can\\'t listen to it at the highest setting. But if that\\'s your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud!3. ANC: ANC is present, but won\\'t drown everything out. It\\'s a great add on but if you\\'re looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this won\\'t do that. If you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick!  3.1 Ambient Sound mode: The opposite of ANC, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. Again, you can\\'t blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume (near 25% volume) and hear things around you. If the ambient sound also increased as I increased volume, it would have been amazing.4. Calling: Did a couple of calls. With no-noise, the other person said I sounded great! I took a couple of calls in a local grocery store (was pretty loud) and the other end had no issue hearing me.5. Buttons: The button placement is easy and I didn\\'t feel any issue getting used to the controls. The simple manual explains everything in 2 mins, so read once and you\\'re good to go.  5.1 To note: The sound is best in DIRAC Opteo mode. Every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. I\\'d have loved having it on by default. Also every time I turn it on, it plays a 3-4 second tune, which could have been shorter. (Imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. Ugh.)6. Connectivity: Once I connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within 1-2 seconds of turning the earphones on.7. Battery: It seems to last long! I\\'ve been using them for about 4.5 hrs and it\\'s gone down about 20%. Cannot say anything more yet though.  7.1 When you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesn\\'t auto pause like some of the competitors. Annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.8. Build quality: I have a black version. It\\'s made with good quality plastic and didn\\'t feel heavy around my neck. It doesn\\'t have metal anywhere, and it\\'s quite simple. I think it looks decent.9. Exercise: Need to test! Will update later.In summary, an easy recommendation. If you can overlook the small issues, there\\'s a great sounding, feature-packed and long lasting device here at a great price! 10/10 would definetely recommend!,First I was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say it\\'s got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons, bass is good, vocals are much clearer in Crystal bionic mode, ANC is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but don\\'t except any more than that, no issues with call enx is working upto it\\'s name, battery is sufficient around 12-14 hours if you mix up the modes.. Overall a decent all rounded neckband, jack of all and king of none.,All other things such as sound quality, battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly. If I connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time. It does not work many times. If headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you won\\'t be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop. This is a big bug. Please fix this.,This BoAt 330 ANC Neckband is very Good but needs improvement and fixes.Pros:-• Nice Sound Quality while using Crystal Bionic Sound, but it\\'s average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points.• Great Build Quality• It\\'s ANC & Ambience mode is good in this price range.• It\\'s quite Comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting.• It has Dual Pairing which is very good but it\\'s not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing, e.g., while receiving a call on one device, the audio/video being played at another device won\\'t Pause (you have to manually pause) instead there won\\'t be any sound output through that device. Its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device, as this is available on BoAt Rockerz 335 and a few different BoAt Neckbands.Cons:-• It\\'s range is very low considering Bluetooth v5.2, I even have BoAt neckband with v5.0 which has better range. Even a single wall coming in between 3-4ms can block the sound output.• Its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly 8-10 hours everyday with Bionic Crystal Mode/ANC enabled.• While using Dual Pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between. And the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices. (This happened on the Replacement unit I received, maybe it\\'s not the case with your unit).• Sometimes no sound is received while playing Audio from both devices. (I don\\'t know if it\\'s wrong with my unit or every unit.)Overall this is a good and considerable Neckband under 2k if you want Good Bass-Rich Sound Quality, ANC/Ambience mode and Descent battery life.But if your requirements mostly is Dual Pairing, then this is not for you. As I bought this considering Dual Pairing feature most importantly. But it\\'s not really seamless in between Devices, but still it\\'s the best possible available feature in this price range or even under 5k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficient.Another problem with Dual Pairing is that the media doesn\\'t gets paused on first device if there\\'s a call on the second one, which is already there on BoAt\\'s few other Neckbands, but then there is no Media-Pause feature on them. (e.g., If audio is being played on 2 devices first device Audio will get paused if Audio is played on second device and vice-versa).So do try it out by yourself. Because it\\'s my personal experience with the Neckband, maybe you get a better experience.Thanks for Reading. Happy Shopping!,Bought this one after using Rockerz 255 pro for over 2 years now. Comparing this with that, that one was ergonomically better, felt snug in ears.Standalone review of this.1. Noise Cancellation is just alright, not too great, not too bad.2. Sound Quality is definitely great and excellent with the Bionic Sound feature. Kudos on that part.3. Bass Quality is fairly good at this price point.4. Holds charge for as long as advertised.5. Overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky & cheap (atleast on the funky grey one which I bought because it was priced lowest).Conclusion:Good Product at a Fair Price i.e. Nothing too great but nothing bad either. It is very easy to use.,Good and easy to use.,Overall built is good but button quality is very poor. If you have ₹200 more then i suggest you to go with \"FX-991 ES Classic\", it\\'s much better choice than this.,Nice productRecommended from entering college,Like,Amazon very good experience, excellent 👌,All function under one segment.so i like it.I sey for all engineering student u purchase only this because this is the best for your problem.this is a solution understand.,Very good Liked easy set-up. Disliked having to download and app and create a account,An awesome product. This covers 2 floor plus terrace in a 1800 sqft house. You can buy this product without any concern. I would suggest you to have tp link router too to be bought along this for a seemless experience,Product is good,I have received the product from amazon in pristine condition and it works very well as described. I am using it in my first floor room where I have low signal for my wifi and gets disconnected when i close the doors. The extender helps to resolve the issue and configuration was also really easy. One of the only minor issue is at very random times ( rarely) this gets automatically disconnected, but can be reconnected easily by going to wifi settings of device.,Everything is nice except range!,Good item,Using in my 2BHK home as getting weak wifi network from router and slow Internet speed. It is easy to setup and does increases range as well as speed tremendously than original router. Option of 5G & 5GExt works great. Horizontal range is quite good as for vertical range at height of 1st floor is perfect and on 2nd floor its manageable. Doesn\\'t heat not heat that much. Surely go for it little costly but worth it.,Use the Tether app, do the installation by yourself & enjoy the WiFi. Helped improve network connectivity in my house. VALUE FOR MONEY. Do look out for this product during SEASONAL SALE for a better deal. sound of song are good its really good or i am still using almost maybe 2 or 3 month maybe more but they still good,Product is in good quality and comfortably fixed in our ears but the major issue is when we were buds for few minutes, it will start hurting our ears,Iam satisfied with the sound quality, 4.7/5Ok with the noise cancellation performance.But when it comes to bass quality it is some what less than the boat 225. Not too much low, clarity in the bass is some what Missing, light weight when compared to boat 225. Finally boat 242 is good at. Its price range.,Mic, sound quality crystal clear , bass is also good and the wiring quality is very good overall earphone is very good in this range. Worth hai product me,Bought them 2 months ago... No other complains so far.... Everything going great...But are little overpriced for 550,Nice,Bast,Gaming -niceSound-osm😎Disyan-nice and value for moneyThank you amezon ♥️ Review written on 09-12-2022It is a nice little tripod for your Phone / mini camera or Gopro. It has Rubber grips, which makes it anti Slip on flat surfaces and feels sturdy in your hand.Here are few Pros and Cons u should know before buying.● PROS▪︎Light weight and easy to assemble.▪︎Very Good for small devices.▪︎Stability is superb.▪︎Comes with Bluetooth remote.▪︎Quality of Rubber and Plastic is great● CONS▪︎Size is quite small, it looks little bigger in the images shown.▪︎ Not at all Suitable for Big DSLR cameras or video cameras.▪︎ I think that the rotaion of the balls can become loose after several months of use. I\\'LL Update here.●Final Verdict : For the price of ₹400, It is a good product as it is quite useful when you vlog or want to take group photos. It will easily carry your Mobile phones and small cameras but DONT EVEN think of mounting your professional camera on it, it is very small compared to big cameras.Go for it!! It\\'s a great product.,I basicly purchased it to record timeplace video but when I recieved it I was surprised because it was soo good at a less and affordable price but I gave it 4 stars because of the Bluetooth remote as it was unable to click photos and i even changed the battery but it didnot worked,Product is very good as compare to the price.Personal Opinion : A little bit quality of the material with a bit more size could have been improved.,Good But Could Be More Better.Can\\'t Take Mobile WeightNeed To Adjust Stand Every Time For Single Click.,,This tripod is a good purchase. Pretty standard quality, i must say. Bluetooth remote also works perfectly. Not very suitable for hefty dslr cameras. Good for mobile phones and vlogging.,I m use this product from 1.5 year no complain,Learning needed I ordered 128GB but got 119GB.,It\\'s a good deal to get the SD card in this price, but it was even less in Reliance digital.

In first two times, they delivered fake sd card with the same samsung branding but thanks to Amazon for accepting return request. In third time I got this genuine Samsung Evo Plus SD Card 64gb. I purchased this card in Rs. 599. You can also get this at less price during offer season. The least price I have seen is Rs. 539.Performance is almost good as I expected.Write Speed is about 17 to 25 mbps and Reading speed is around 35 to 45 mbps. But I did not tested reading speed too much. May be you will get better reading speed. Adapter is also good quality and performing good.Thank You...🙂,Go for it ensure size It\\'s a good product.,Like,Very good item strong and useful USB cableValue for moneyThanks to amazon and producer,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51112ZRE-1L._SY88.jpg,Good,Nice product and useful product,-,Sturdy but does not support 33w charging Best Fingerprint Scanner Divice.,Easy to use,Ink cartridges are easy to install.

Bought total 12 pieces in Rs99. Loved it ❤️,Quality product,So far ok. Will hold the wire connecting after the USB joints. But couldn\\'t stop it from bending,Don’t even think of buying this by just looking at the cheap price of this product as it has been made by cheap quality plastic which can not protect your cables as it is not at all sturdy so please don’t buy,Only two packs came,The product is cool. Value for money. Love it Value for money,Grt product,Please ensure the size of your keyboard is fit for this cover. Secondly, it has bad adhechesive.,got the keyboard protector at 39 Rs.

But transfer speed is slow.,some glich happening otherwise good Update: Now after this review they have told me to give them atleast a 4 star review just to even consider arranging for the replacement, not even  guaranteed. Now lets see if they actually do as promised.Original Review:  After 6 months it stopped working, so raised a request for it. But.. i have to courier it to them cost Rs 100, then they found that it was a problem with the PCB they changed it, ok good but they replaced it with the PCB of ProBass which is an older and lower priced model. When i shared them the screenshots  and asked them for an explaination they just asked it to be couriered back paying for their mistake. No Reimbursment, No Quality Suppport,  No resposnse to emails apart from the standard script. One of the Most Regretted Purchase.,The product is a looking good but not a good sound quality, and then packaging is a very poor I think People open the product when it is packaged. For that the package is cut and things are different,I think that these companies make people think a little ....,,Spare eartips were missing from the package I received so that was disappointing.Sound quality is good for the price.ENC is decent.The eartips are excellently designed so the earphones fit well. You can run without any issues.It doesn\\'t feel stuffy into the ear.I already have a bose qc30 and sennheiser BT headset but was looking for light neckband headphones for the convenience it offers and I am really satisfied with this.Good buy over all. I would recommend to Go for it.,Connecting only one device,getting off after3 minute,WhatsApp incoming call not working proper ,caller couldn\\'t hear receiver voice.,I have issue in this product... One side is not working so please look into this,Good,Good Product is good and I like that . Performance is good 😊,its working good . nice product.... its worthable for this rate!,The wireless mouse  is working well. There is one problem. Those who start using the mouse have to switch on  and they should  switch off  when their work over. If they forget to switch off( which can happen to many users) the battery may get drained. The manufacturer should  find another method  in the place of the on/off switch.,Scroller movement is not good,It is best useful mouse bcoz wireless mouse for work from my shop.I am csc shopper so it\\'s need to me. so smooth work for laptop or pc thank and again thanks for Amazon delivery services.This wireless mouse is very smoothly working. Thank you so much,Good product, worked fine...,It\\'s good and very handy,The mouse is easy to use. But I expected a little bigger mouse at this price range. --------------Update after 8 months--------------Update 1: The problem mentioned in the earliest review is becoming more and more dire with time. Now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half, whereas left one keeps going, so reducing one star. Will contact them for replacement and update here.Update 2: Called service center, they asked to bring it, but am lazy. I expected they\\'d replace at home. Paid more attention towards the issue above. The stable situation is that just after full charge, right bud can go upto 4 hrs, but left one always goes for 30-60mins more, and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two (when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems), so I guess I can still use the buds but with certain restrictions :) Will happily restore 5 stars if the issue stays stable for next 3 months.--------------Update after 6 months--------------No change in quality, still the pack charges the buds like a boss. During this period, they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour (very dangerous, thankfully he couldn\\'t swallow them!), full of saliva and whatnot, and on another occasion I threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force (undisclosed depressing reason) due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached, which I then re-attached. After all this, buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day 1. I think these are pretty darn sweet deals! Lack of volume control, etc. etc. is all forgiven. Happy customer. Although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists.-------------------Original review-------------------Using for last 2 months.I am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist. But I hadn\\'t used any tws yet, so wanted to dip my toes and didn\\'t want to invest much, but also not something throwaway. So settled for boult (no boat etc. due to their highly adultered sound signature), since I have previous experience with it. I like my music flat at studio quality. More recently, I\\'ve been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance: oneodio pro50. Go ahead and search it. It is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fans.Coming to this tws.Connectivity. Right out of the box, only left one was working after connecting to my iphone. Maybe right one didn\\'t pair correctly to left. Did that reset thing as suggested (which also took some effort), but after that, both started working and since then, no issues. I am using both my phone and laptop (linux). Ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another. But perfect connectivity now. I can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss, which is great.Call quality is decent, faced no disconnects yet, and the other party is also ok with my voice, but you cannot talk in a hushed voice, you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand you.Features. Tapping is oddly sensitive, I mean it responds even if I am adjusting the bud, and not touching the central area, but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to play/pause. I can get used to that though. One thing, track aage peeche is ok. But these don\\'t have anything which can control the volume. Bummed on that.Battery. Decent backup. It\\'s been nearly 2 months. I use buds on an average of 2-3 hours daily, and I just had to charge the main case just 3-4 times. In an emergency I also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly. I was happy to see that. One weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left, infact I can use the left one 20-30 mins more that the right. But anyways, I put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery.Sound quality.Bass frequencies: Very decent bass. Surprisingly great low bass (songs like \\'the humma song\\', \\'i wanna love you\\' sound pretty good), but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass (\\'lut gaye\\' by Jubin doesn\\'t sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature). Overall for the most part, you should be fine.Other frequencies: I\\'ll review this from vantage point of studio quality signature. For mids, the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass (but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above), but its bearable. For highs, initially I felt the presence [a bit] lacking, which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks, but after using it for a few days, I started feeling alright in that aspect, maybe some burn in? God knows. Also remembering that I paid just 1800 bucks for these! I mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so I think my mind won\\'t be nitpicking then. I\\'ll soon be upgrading though.Overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k. Cheers!,Hey.  .This one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice that\\'s the only disadvantage on this one..,Right buds not performs well, I am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,Been using these for a month now. Can\\'t massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough (may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass) and provides good noise isolation. Very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and I use it every day. If you can snag it on a deal for ~1500 bucks it\\'s a fantastic deal.,My only issue is,  we can\\'t change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click.  Every thing else is fine.,Best at price. and require some button for operation.,call pick up /rejection function, next song play function not working on single touch,Product is good but battery not as expected Use Remote Car... Wall Watches... and Other...,Batteries are as usual nice,Good,Mrp 180Got it for 112/-Best deal,Good,Got it on high discounts n works really well compared to other batteries.,Value for money,Dislike Very bad performance even for normal work. Even this model is not mentioned under their official website.Tried many times to contact customer care no response.,Good product but Pekeging not good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/4170T3S5xWL._SY88.jpg,I am not reviewing this as per gaming experience but per daily heavy use.I find it very helpful for me who use mouse whole day with a lot of left and right clicks, drag and drops, scrolls and scroll clicks. I didn\\'t find any glitches so far. Works perfectly for me.About looks, It looks beautiful almost like a small pet who can change colour. But it can be a little disturbing if you are using it in dark. otherwise the best thing is, it doesn\\'t need any installation headaches.Only reason I deducted one star is because this mouse is a little oversized for my hand. So, people with little hands will struggle at first but eventually, with time and use, you will feel like it shrank.I like zebronics because I trust their products.If you are thinking of buying it, go for it.👍,A good mouse. Not the best but good enough.,Good,Its good but idk if its only with me but the mouse sometimes becomes unresponsive. Not for long tho just 2 3 seconds. Overall would recommend.,Good mouse little heavyweight Its worth it,At this price the product is very nice. And easy to use for beginners also. Kids love and enjoy while working these wonderful acrylic colors,I ordered these to use for painting wooden ornaments with my 11-year old niece and her friend. I was pleasantly surprised because the price was good for what I received. These are glass jars and full to the top :). We were able to pour out little drops onto paper plate “palettes” and there is a lot of paint left.  The paint mixed well to make custom colors. This paint would also work well for lots of craft projects including painting art pictures on paper, on rocks, or t-shirts too.,Good product,It\\'s quality is very high and very good for kids,also it\\'s really cheap ☺️,I Used it on a canvas, i liked how the colors are vibrant and unique,Love 💓 the colours... Easy to use and are waterproof,The quality is good. Good deal at this price Mousepad is sturdy enough doesn\\'t move around a lot. The print is a bit rough. Expect this much smoothness at this price point. Overall decent product Will get your job done,In hand texture is good. May not be good for gaming as it feels little brisk after using it directly on table not sure it will be like that itself or it\\'s my experience.,Corners should be stitched, but overall its the best quality in this price. Value buy,I like it,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71dj1uPfkmL._SY88.jpg,Its smooth and cool and the bottom is made up of rubber which prevents it from moving while the mouse moves. Its great value for money. Easy and smooth,I want to return my order Case is hard and spacious.hard disc and  other pandrive, cables etc you can put easily .it is good to safety and storage.,Fit product for palm size hard drives,value for money purchase,Quality  is good . Looking is nice .light in weight,good product in this price segment,Best for this price,Ok ok product but with comparison to price good product.I recommend you to buy.,It is amazing that we are not manufacturing such a thing in india. Good :Sound quality - surprising at this price, in built acoustic/3d sound (nice), bass is not overpowering (good on ears), instrumental details, dialogues and background music/chatter is also clearNot harsh at all (thumbs up)Looks are okay, battery backup good do farBad :Noise cancellation is just a hype, used for in-house calls - couldn’t block outside car noise/horns, even light switch on-off noise, kitchen noises-cooking/dish cleaning were audible on the other endMild ear pain after using for couple of hoursBluetooth connection range is very low, it starts to drop the audio beyond 10 feetMissing :No battery status notification, no auto offOverall :Good for movies, series, music but not for office meetings/phone calls,Everything is good but build quality is okay okay.,Only thing I liked is good battery and bass,Soundquality aand base quality is good.,Good quality voice,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71KU7iGuaiL._SY88.jpg,Good bass, ok tremble,Very good I have just received my BoultCurve.

So I have been using Boult ProBass Curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bullet-points to make it easy for the prospective buyers. I was thinking to buy a quality Bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended. I was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then. Moreover, I found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling. Its that time I started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search. I took good time (months) to look for a good product. And, this is when I decided to purchase this item. Before purchase I devoted time to read the user\\'s reviews (that I always do before making any purchase-small or big) and found myself convinced. Finally, I decided to go for it. Ok. So, no more essay writing :) Let me get straight to the key points:1. I bought this for 999 under Sale so saved INR 499. (it\\'s a good saving. As Warrent Buffet says \"every penny saved is every penny earned\")2. This has great sound quality. I could not compare it against any other product because I don\\'t have any other bluetooth headset with me :) But this will surely not let you down. It is very loud even at 80% volume level. You just cannot listen to at that level; forget about full volume. Bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either. Good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to 100%. Excellent sound clarity!3. I am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external sound/noise or very very minimal that is not noticeable. So, this stands perfect at this point.4. Performs excellent while taking a call. You will a get a crystal clear voice when you make/take a call using this device. You will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone. In fact, it\\'s even better at times when the voice from the other side is low. I really love the hands-free calling because I have to take long calls with the clients in my job.5. Battery backup is excellent!!! It can last anywhere from 10 to 11 hours. I have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage. And, I mean it. I tested it for almost a month with day-wise log capture. Please see the detailed tracking at the end. It gets full charged in 2 hours approx.6. Bluetooth range is good. It covers a distance of 10 to 15 feet easily. It\\'s quite enough if not good enough. My figures may be wrong. Beware! It\\'s just my rough estimate. Haven\\'t tested is rigorously.7. Design looks good and is very convenient to wear. The wires are adjustable as per need. This is a nice thing. Looks cool when you wear it around your neck. I chose Red color.8. Last but not the least. It comes with 1 year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music :)Judgement: Just go for it if you have a limited budget or don\\'t want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset. I was hesitant to spend anything beyond 1000 bucks on a bluetooth headset. It was my personal limitation.PS: Battery backup log:16 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the morning song play + WebEx call with Suneel17 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the afternoon song play17 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 20 minutes approx at night video play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the evening video play21 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play21 May start 22 minutes approx video play in the eveningBattery deadTotal battery time 11 hour 12 minutes*****************************************************22 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play22 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play23 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play23 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play24 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play24 May 1 hour 10 minutes approx in the evening video play26 May 27 minutes approx in the evening video play27 May 1 hour 29 minutes approx in the morning song play27 May 1 hour 27 minutes approx in the evening video playTotal time 11 hr 13 minutes*******************************************************28 May 1 hour 46 minutes approx in the morning song play28 May 1 hour 17 minutes approx in the evening video play29 May 1 hour 57 minutes approx in the morning song play29 May 1 hour in the evening video play30 May 1 hour 48 minutes approx in the morning song play30 May 55 minutes approx in the evening video play31 May 1 hour 24 minutes approx in the morning song play10 hour 07 minutesBattery discharged***************************************************31 May 1 hour 12 minutes approx in the evening video play03 June 1 hour 38 minutes approx song play in the morning03 June 1 hour 17 minutes approx video play in the evening04 June 1 hour 28 minutes approx song play in the morning04 June 1 hour 11 minutes approx video play in the evening05 June 23 minutes approx video play at night06 June 1 hour 47 minutes approx song play in the morning06 June 50 minutes approx video play in the eveningTotal time 9 hour 46 minutesBattery discharged******************************************************07 June 8.34 am start song play 10.06 end 1 hour 32 minutes approx07 June 6.47 pm start video play 7.53 pm end 1 hour 10 minutes approx08 June 11.38am start song play 12.37 59 minutes approx end 2.16pm start song play 4.04 pm 1 hour 48 minutes approx end10 June 8.37 am start song play 10.14 am end 1 hour 37 minutes approx10 June 6.27 pm start video play 7.46pm end 1 hour 19 minutes approx11 June 9.10am start song play 10.51am end 1 hour 41 minutes approx11 June 6.55 pm video play 7.46pm end 51 minutes approxBatter dischargedTotal time 10 hour 57 minutes approx,You have to purchase a headphone I recommend for this one. Under 1000 rupees best one..,No battery🔋 backup and no flexible to use, they don\\'t satisfied with provided features,I am writing this review after used of 30 days the product is really very good, sound quality, durability, battery performance is also very good,Overall its a fair product...Rs. 899...with all the features...Its perfect for daily commute since it has a very good battery life, it will last for 3 to 4 days easily.When it comes to the sound quality, i feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious. It would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product. You cant have everything at once. This is my personal opinion, since i am a music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phones.Other than that its worth trying, totally recommend this product if you daily travel for work and you are looking for a budget wireless earphone,Sound quality is not best,I LIKED THIS PRODUCT. ALREADY USING SINCE FEW DAYS. BATTERY BACK IS ALSO VERY GOOD. I bought this power-bank to use during my vacation with family. It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side. Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,Bit heavy but does it’s job. Takes tooooooo much time to charge. Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,I needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity. So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try, as i already have Honor & MI power banks (10000mAh ones). Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones, iit did live up to my expectations for the 1k range.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••→ Powerbank→ MicroUSB cable→ Carry pouch (depends on which package you received, more below)→ User manual/Warranty card→ General leaflet→ Feedback leaflet••••••••••••••••••••••••📝 SOME DETAILS••••••••••••••••••••••••→ Mfg: October 2019→ Charging time: 9 Hrs 50 Min (via 10W charger, low battery indication to full charge)→ Backup: Was able to charge (5-100%) Redmi Note 5 pro\\'s 4000Mah battery ~3.5 times with regular usage in between.••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. High capacity power bank with dual input (micro USB or USB C).2. Dual output via 2 USB ports.3. Not a fast charge/quick charge device but has an output of 5V/2.4A (12W) which is good enough.4. Touch button for power checks or switch it on for charging device.5. It comes with a carry pouch. (more below on this part).6. Compact form factor & sturdy design with ABS body.•••••••••••••➖ CONS•••••••••••••1. It does not auto-start charging when the device is connected.2. Since it has a touch button instead of push-button, it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling.3. There is a lot of conversion loss & backup is slightly less for a 20000mAh power bank.▶ Cons are significant enough to reduce 1 star. There is scope for improvement (points 1 & 2) in this product in the same range. So ★★★★ device.••••••••••••••••••••💡 LED STATUS••••••••••••••••••••→ 1st/2nd/3rd/4th LED blinking (while charging power bank): Status of charge in terms of no of LEDs blinking→ 1/2/3/4 LEDs solid white (while charging other devices): Status of remaining battery in terms of no of LEDs→ One blinking (while charging other devices): Low battery→ All 4 LED solid glow: Battery fully charged•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••🔊 AMBRANE BOX DEBATE•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. When i first received this power bank it came in a small box (approx 12x9x3cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) with everything forced in congested space. The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal & no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away.→ This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch.2. When replacement came, it came in a poly-wrapped bigger box (22x10x4 cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging. The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. Looked like it was applied with an open box. So its presence was useless.→ This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch.••••••••••••••••••••••••👜 CARRY POUCH••••••••••••••••••••••••→ As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box.→ Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. (Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. Neither loose nor tight.→ Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon.••••••••••••••••🏆 VERDICT••••••••••••••••▶ At the price point its not a bad deal. Its a midway path b/w low quality and high-quality ones. You can very well go for Ambrane, as it makes good quality & durable power banks. Rest, nothing is perfect in this world. For this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1-year warranty from Ambrame is available.▶ If one can extend the budget by a few hundred, MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body & better quality overall. I have MI, Honor & Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be (from low to high) Ambrane → Honor → MI,I am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family. Before to this i have bought their PP-30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. My dad uses Redmi note 7, my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you don\\'t need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same- Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP-30- Solid and sturdy built- 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product-  ₹200 cheaper price than MI- Touch button at the top to know the power status (this is something unique)-  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13% to 100% at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro- I don\\'t know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 Amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself. I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dad\\'s Redmi note 7 (which supports QC 4.0) either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP-30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampCons:-- Very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box- It has some adhesive tape at the top i don\\'t know why ? which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same- No torch light, their PP-30 have it- only micro cable inside the box,Definitely heavy but I knew this. I will recommend this, as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phones.,Nice product,Power backup is good.. but the USB cable provided is very bad. It stopped working after few months of usage,Everything is good but the battery don’t last that long when use for charging two device. Build quality is good and it is comes with 2 year warranty.,Good Product,Bought it for charging my mobile & tab but it doesn\\'t work for Lenovo m8 tab,Guys this cable is is best compare of everyone over heat protection, quickly charging, but chance to shock circuit,good,Nice,Good quality,1.5एम का डाटा केबल मेरे लिए बहुत ही लाभदायक है ।  मैं इस केबल को लाइन में चार्ज करते समय फोन बहुत आराम से उपयोग  कर पा रहा हु । आप इस केबल से 15watt का  चार्जर उसे कर सकते है (इससे जड़ा नही) । लोकल बाजार में इसका दाम 150 है ,  अमेजन पे ये केबल मुझे 67 में मिला । गर्व से कहो हम हिंदू है , जय हिंद जय भारत , Good,I use this to solve my numericals and its good.,Excellent tool for kids in learning,A quality product,Good product,Product is amazing and less weight good use of it and u can go for it,Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uctVLMIjL._SY88.jpg Stand is good. But the light is not that bright. In photos it Feels bright but irl not that use of the light.Also setting up the light and stand takes bit of effort.Quality of stand and parts is average .I bought it for Rs 800 but I won’t recommend u guys to pay even a rupee more than Rs 400 for it.,Good product,I liked it as it is easy to use and helpful in clicking better pictures,Easy to handle..worthy..,Great product for beginners,good,Light quality is really good at this price segment,I really liked it\\'s portability as we can take this to another place easily, Nice portable .. liked it..,Reducing one star as packaging was not good.Mouse is big.If you prefer small and travel friendly mice go for someother design.,The mouse looks good, and it is even easy to hold and use due to to it\\'s design. The only issue I found out was with the battery port, the cover for the battery doesn\\'t come off easily and that\\'s the worst part. Also, the battery cover has some opening provided, not sure why.,Ok worthy,Good product,Good deal but big size,Noisy while scrolling,At 1st they send me a used one with missing adapter, than replaced with a new one, previously i was using logi m190 full-size mouse , its wheel stopped working properly within a year ,  thats why i bought this full-size wireless mouse hp x200 @ ₹488 , with 3 years warrenty, clicks are soft on logi also they have increased the price of it from 600 to 1100, but there is no use if it doesn\\'t work properly, let\\'s see ... I used this product for about 4 months and really had no issues with it, until I noticed that my internet stopped working. After getting it checked I found out that the issue was in the UPS (maybe wiring cable) which stopped transmission.I contacted the customer care and I was assisted by Mr. Ankit. He was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too. After ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same. Hoping to receive the replacement soon so that I can continue uninterrupted internet !!,I have been using this product for the past four months, during this tenure I had faced no issues initially but roughly after 3 months the power back up started shrinking extremely and the least duration was under 30 minutes, that’s when I contacted the customer support via whatsapp and I must say the whole experience with the customer support team was simply surprising. They were very polite and helpful throughout the process. It was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged a replacement for the product since it is just 3-4 months old. They took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me a new product which I am currently using, now the back up I am getting is 4+ hours which is based on my usage.So finally I am not sure how often I buy a product from this brand but I will never forget the support I received from this this brand. Cheers!!!,I purchased the product 10 days back and initial product was not working properly. But I received a replacement for that. Thanks for immediate response from the support team. I liked Oakter because it\\'s Indian product and NOT a Chinese. As of now it\\'s working fine and no lag in Wi-Fi connection or speed. Need to test the recharge capacity when the Power goes off. Will keep you updated after a month again by checking the results. Giving 4 Stars as of now.,This is a really good option for those who are primarily concerned about being cut off from online meetings/calls due to frequent short term power cuts, and are not willing to spend more amount buying an inverter. I have been using this product since around 3 months and am pretty happy with its backup.,I have been using the product for more than a year. Later I purchased a second product for my parents home and it was working fine for 6 months. However the backup battery stopped working later and the customer support team were quick to respond and swiftly sent me the replacement product.,Product was delivered very promptly and packaging was good. Using this product just from couple of days and its working as expected. Very easy to plug & use. Reserving 1 star for longevity of this product, will revise my rating after a year or so depending on my experience.,The device doesn\\'t support for 4 hours. It support only for 2 or 2 hours 30 minutes max on full recharge.Product is affordable, light and good. Please don\\'t fool on 4 hours support capacity. Resonate UPS is better as compared  to this.,This product claims to give backup for upto 4hours. But it wont even give backup for 30 mins. I claimed warranty and got the new product as well still the same problem. They reiterate and say upto 4 hours where they shud mention clearly that it will give backup upto 1 hour not more than that.One of the worst customer support services i have seen. The associates keep repeating the same sentence or copy paste the chat and dont provide solutions. Totally disappointed and waste of money. Never recommending anyone to buy their product. My ISP provided modem-router combo is in another location in the house, and I was getting speed drops on 5 Ghz when I was across the house [as was expected]. So, I decided to buy this router to use as an access point. The setup is pretty straightforward, provided you know what you are doing.As is mentioned on the product page, this router comes with two modes -- router mode and access point mode. If you are using it in addition to your ISP provided modem-router, I would suggest using it in the access point mode only.The range and the speeds are working better than I expected for the price -- certainly better than the router that the ISP provides. The router does come with a LAN cable, but the quality of the cable is not very confidence inspiring. The LEDs on the front can be configured via the Tether app to switch off at specific times, which is a neat feature. Apart from that, I have found Tether app to be pretty useless. It doesn\\'t specify the device identity for some reason, just shows the IP and \"unknown\", until you rename the device yourself. Sometimes it doesn\\'t even list all the devices connected. I guess it is better to use the router settings from the browser itself if you want to dig into the settings.I would like to add one more thing in the end. This router looks pretty slick, and I don\\'t think it has gotten enough credits for that. Kept on the table, or even hung from the wall, it looks and feels premium for the price -- and that is in addition to all the amazing features it has.,Router gets sometime auto disconnected even though it is connected to internet,I don\\'t have any issue with router but sure with Amazon packaging method bcz no paper bag or anything were used it was only the box,Good product for that price. Good range,So far everything looks good, wIll update the review after a few months of usage!,Awasome experience, go for it with out any hasitation, assistance also very good.,Highly recommended to purchase, overall a good purchase, you will never regrate after purchasing it.,Signal strength can be improved further.So far good to go. The product was received without damaged and seal intact. Coming on to the product I bought the jazzy blue sunburn edition.Pros:Battery is good, used as opened from the pack it held good for about 10 hours across 4 days and still charge is leftSound- Sensible Bass and good mids as well as lows, not that I can discern between them.Aux available.The ear cups are quite big hence sorta provides passive noise isolation.Cons:Not foldable as well as type b charger (USB micro) typeBeing a limited edition if your ear cups wear off very miniscule chances of replacing it with suitable colorIf a person is of hot body type(emits heat or more warm then normal) there is higher chances of feeling warmth in your ears, as I heard the material just reflects the heat back on to ears. That\\'s just plain uncomfortable to me.Also the build feels very flimsy and plastic-ky.Also a major drawback I felt was that whenever we switch on/off we get the built-in audio!,Bought it for 1499. Now after 2 years 2 months, today it broke. After 6 months of use, the red coating started peeling off. But device showed no problems. Sound is clear, balanced, not very hogh but enough bass, good battery backup, charges faster, aux is available. Disadvantage is you can\\'t fold it. Planning to buy it again, as I think this the best in segment. Now the rate has increased to 1799.,The first thing I want to say is that the headphone is really bulky. I didn\\'t notice the first few days of using but eventually it gives pain on the shoulder if worn for a longer period of time (3-4 hours), sound quality is good. Do not have any bass, ANC is not present in this headphone. It\\'s a decent headphone for casual purposes. If you\\'re a music lover or wear your headset for longer period of time then I think you should invest in other options, which is light weight and have ANC in them.,Everything is great about boat products. Delivered in two days.Noise cancelling is great. Bluetooth connectivity is good. Something it takes time to connect. If you planning to buy then this would be a great choice.,in details it was written that it has physical noise isolation feature in it  but when it came I didn\\'t observe as such feature I bought it for study purpose that the reason why I was looking for such feature but I found it as a waste of money.,Sometimes .. sound doesn\\'t work .. you have to decrease the volume to zero and then increase again to hear the sound. Bu this happens only 1 out of 10 times.,Build quality is good, has physical noice isolation, soft padded, comfortable, but bass could be quite better, otherwise everything is fine,Best for Gym, study, online lectures, entertainment etc.Please Go for it 🥂👍🏻,Good quality headphones in Over the ear category. Good quality sound but has less bass as other says but it\\'s decent. Good mic quality for meetings but doesn\\'t have any noise-cancellation feature. I just feel that after 3-4 hours of constant use these earphones feel weighted to the neck.

The housings are ergonomically shaped housings and angled at 45 degrees. They do not fall out of the ears easily, even during intense activities. The silicone tips are nothing to write home about, but that is expected considering the price.There is a three-button inline remote with mic located right below the right earpiece, which can be used to answer calls, control music playback, and trigger the voice assistant on your smartphone. The buttons themselves are quite mushy and difficult to distinguish between by touch alone.Xiaomi Mi Earphones performanceXiaomi claim that the Mi Earphones feature a \\'3rd generation balanced damping system\\' that creates a transparent sound, and \\'metal sound chambers\\' created via a 20-step process. Marketing fluff aside, how do the earphones really sound? Simply put: surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for two.While most earphones in this price range have over-inflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range, the bass response on the Mi Earphones is controlled and restrained. It doesn\\'t overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs. That said, bassheads will be left slightly wanting.It\\'s surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix, although they do get overpowering sometimes. The mids are slightly repressed, which is evident in vocal-heavy genres such as blues. While the clarity on offer is decent for the price, songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy. This is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bass.,This earphone set is fantastic. And highly deserving of money. I used it for a while last in 2022, and now I\\'m buying it once more in 2023. In my perspective, the Mi headset has good music and is easy to use.,good good,Nice product.Gentle bassNo loud soundProduct quality is decentDon\\'t expect heavy music experience,It\\'s sometime uncomfortable but it\\'s fine i can adjust,Seriously if you are a bass lover, then you can go for it.But it\\'s built quality is not good, it will damage automatically after 3-4 months,it is not suitable for rough uses.,Got it for less than 300rs. Not disappointted at all.If you compare it with other brands like Boat, the sound quality isn\\'t as good as the contemporaries. But for the price I paid, I\\'m not disappointed at all.The bass is solid. Noise cancellation is average and the earphones are a little low on volume, could\\'ve been louder.Good value for money product for earphones under 300.,Very Good product as expected Goid,Best Education Gadget For Kids,Brightness needs to improved,Nice,Good,Liked by kids, hassle free, dust free.Can improve the screen brightness n font visibility,Good,I ordered black but it came blue , although not a big issue colour doesn\\'t matter tht much but functioning is ok so its good..!! The product is very good. Keya are ergonomic. After using it for 2 months, the keys are starting to get hard.. let\\'s see how it performs in the future,For daily use value for money normal typing is good spacebar key is not properly pressed overall good to buy cheap product,I mean it is not a bad keyboard but i can get the same keyboard at local store for cheap price without paying for delivery so please consider this before buying.,After using standard boards like Logitech this seems to be with narrow gap between keys.  I have to adjust myself and careful not pressing two keys.  But it is smooth and without noise.  May be useful for beginners.  very economical,Good keyboard at affordable price,Good product at this budget but not good for gaming, very basic keyboard,for typing purposes its waste of money rather go for a mechanical keyboard,Nice Worth for money - suitable for Android auto... my purpose served in car....got it for Rs.150,Everything is Okay. But packaging is not good feeling like seller gave is used cable.,Good product,Good product but cost is more.,Original cable,I bought this cable at 129. Using this cable for Android auto in my car. Perfectly works without any glitch.,Original MI cable. Will charge upto 33 watts. Got it for Rs 150.  I have 67 watt charger and I want a cable for my car so I went for it. I checked the performance with battery charging app. The charging speed is exactly half of my 67 watt original cable. Go for it.,It provided me turbo charging. I recommend for all Redmi note 10s mobile phones. As it provide turbo charging. I am veri happy with this product. Build quality cheap plastic ka h 🥲,Mouse functions smoothly.  Buttonclicks perfect. Little bit hard.  Should become easier after some time,Overall good value for money, compact and easy to use. Button bit tight to click. Rest is good no issues,Worth to buy,Budget friendly,Good!,Working fine,3month,Mouse works well, but buttons are pretty hard, especially the scroll wheel button is even harder. The rear end of the mouse, the bulgier side is quite higher hence feels a bit pushy on the palm area of my hand. If you have soft hands, you better explore other options, if it is for rough use then is a good buy. Sound quality is superb noise cancellation is extremely well but bass quality  needs improve ment.,Overall its great the only thing thats poor is the range its not even half a meter! Rest is good,Good,It\\'s a very Good headphone compared to it\\'s price. Previously I had used Sony headphones and those were bit expensive. But I can surly say that these headphone can give you satisfactory quality.,Good battery backup,Like the color and bass,Build quality is not good enough the cousin cover get torn with use fit gets loose over battery life is decent,Like Bluetooth audio sounds really nice, decent bass too, but FM reception is weak. Even after plugging in the usb cable (antenna) the FM reception is not very clear. Its not able to catch all stations and even when it does catch a station, moving the speaker causes problems with the sound clarity. I tried a few other similar speakers from other brands and they all have this problem. Apparently the FM circuit in these soundbar is not good.,Worth for buying this speaker. Sound quality is good and loud. Weightless easy to carry. Good battery backup. It\\'s coming for more than 4hours. Not tested properly but having good battery backup for sure. Don\\'t expect bass. Having little bit but don\\'t expect more. I\\'m writing this review after 5 days of usage.,Yes,Everything fine,Nice and decent product. sound is good.

Overall fine.,I like the usb c  L shape. Nylon Shielded core wire it improves the life of the cable.,i think i buy these every 6 months or so. fast charging stops working after a while. probbly something to do with the cable design. the cable gets twisted over time and I suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside. but i keep buying it because there arent too many options in an L shaped design,Good and durable product. Sometime the charges doesn\\'t work on few adapters. there might be few cut off or something but works fine on apple adapter, Car charger, USB,The product is really good at affordable price.,Good and fast charging, and value for money,பொருள் உடைய கடினத்தன்மையின் நன்றாக உள்ளது சார்ஜ் ஏறும் வேகம் 15wat,Not a fast charger.  Very slow charging with 65w.  L-shape pin is very useful. Made in Indonesia, (thankfully not China).,Good for long use of remote,👏,Battery works as replacement,Serves the purpose, Good seller, Good battery life,Good. Worked for my Ertiga Car Key remote,Working good,Works flawlessly. Good Battery Backup:Good packaging. The Table is good itself and also good grip on floor, one drawback is the edges on board are razor sharp and you might hurt yourself (i hurt myself). could be the best in price point just smoothing (maybe rounding) edges,Great to have for studies and laptop usageFor eating I wouldn\\'t recommendIt slides to one side due to weight of laptopOverall it serves it\\'s purpose ... Good one,Does the job but not stable in the bed because it has a curve design in four sides. If the four sides have a grip to support in surface like floor or bed it would have been a great product. Also the water bottle space was annoying because my laptop was big and i had less space for the mouse.,You have mentioned extra height , more than other brands tables , which is not , it’s the standard size height,Pretty sturdy table, very easy to fold, good rubber grip which holds the table on the floor firmly,What is really interesting is that it has a cup holder and a space for keeping tabs or mobile on the desk, a very handy feature.The only con of this table is that it wobbles if you keep it on your bed, but that is okay.Overall, a great product, worth the money,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NFBXkdADL._SY88.jpg,It\\'s easy to fold and has a good stability.Overall a good product.,I ordered this for someone and they received the product on time, the product was same as described - go for it if you\\'re on a budget The sequential read speeds for a 8gb video file (after reformatting to exfat file system) were 157MBPS constant for a 8.7GB video fileNote- the computer being used for testing has a pcie nvme ssd and a fairly modern and powerful cpu, but machines with a decent cpu and an average SSD ought to perform simillarly with usb 3.0 or aboveThe writes though, were a different story, as in the beginning for about 1.5 gb, the speed was 56MBPS, but then it dropped to 33, and it started throttling because of excessive heating.Difference between the go and the luxe- THIS IS WHERE THE ULTRA DUAL LUXE SINES AS IT DOESNT THROTTLE MUCH, BUT THE NORMAL GO DOES.The throttling occurs due to excessive heat generated, and because of it\\'s plasticky build, it is unable to dissapate that heat, which can harm the NAND flash storage inside it; to prevent this, it reduces its speed and transfers in chunks of about 40MB before pausing briefly. It is a good thing as it prevents damage to the storage component, hence increasing lifespan, but at the cost of speeds. But after 33mpbs, it further drops down to 20, then 13 and becomes stable there. Here it\\'s just too slow for heavy everyday use like transferring videos for editing. (Room temp 24C), your milage may vary with different types of files, computers and ports))But for the vast majority of users, who just use it as a backup, or for once in a while storage, or for regularly working with small files like pots and photos, it\\'s perfectly fine. Its fast, makes it convenient to transfer files between phones and laptops and desktops, because of it\\'s versatile setup of a changeable usb c and a setup. It feels strong and durable, even through its made if plastic.For the price of 719rs (for the 64gb variant) it is not very affordable. A regular usb a pen/flash drive and a type a to c adapter combination (as illustrated above, available for about rs 130 as of writing this review, and a 64GB flash drive costing anywhere between 400 and 550rs as of writing this review) will cost less. But a regular usb drive and the combo will not be as convenient and fast, but again it\\'s not required for most people not to mention that the adapter is quite useful elsewhere as well; but for the small niche of users who want speed and have small files (below 1.5GB at a time) to work with, it\\'s recommend.Otherwise going with the luxe (for performance) or the adapter setup (better value for money) as mentioned above will be a better decision.Hope you find this effort helpful,It would be better if the holder of pendrive is strong enough.And it\\'s very hard to insert into my type c mobile (lgg8x).I got bit scared thinking of it will get broken.Better to buy this in offer the price gets less than I bought. I got it for 720₹.,pros:-received product on time with good package-nice design, portable and easy to use-optimum data transfer speed and reasonable pricecons:-built quality could have been better-type c is not as easy to plug and unplug,It\\'s look good with nice finish. It is very convenient to use. One drawback is plastic is soft it seems fragile compare to metal pendrive.Plastic material is thin and light weight,Storage mentioned 64 but it has only 57.2 gb.Value for money.,Good product, but not so sturdy,Good,Very good product Review OverviewAverage2.7The Boat today launched the ‘ Boat Xtend ‘, the company’s latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs. 2,999. The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69\"), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did\\'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can\\'t figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does\\'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does\\'nt matter as most don\\'t want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,👍,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,It\\'s little expensive but okkk, Nice product,if you want to use your mouse for gaming and stuff life photo editing than please dont purchase thisthis product is for the mouse which is used for web surfing , pdf reading , study , ms office , pros:durability 5/5printing 4/5spill resistance - idkgood for 3200 and 2400 dpi mousecons:too small for gamingvertically it is not so big if your mouse is big[gaming mouse]other than that everything is good total points 4/5,It\\'s very smooth to run the mouse very fast  for gaming and for casual work,Ok,,It\\'s thinner than my existing one but works fine e..looks nice,I would suggest anyone who needs a mouse for daily use due to office work or gaming purpose superb deal at this price.,Mouse detection is good but costly mouse pad Cheap & best genuine black ink 003,First of all, the seller needs to add some more decent photos of the product (first time I searched for it and landed on this one, but honestly I thought it would be a duplicate one, but no it is a original one, photos are attached) .Packing:Packing is ok ok!

If u use no other brands and  zebronics 1st time u become lover to this, still im surprise how they give this product for this price shocking ( aux + type C ) under 700 is shocking bcoz if u go for boat type C product is 1700 aboveZeb or not bad its more ok for this priceSound 4/5  heavy (loud) in full voume looks shouting inside ear , otherwise niceBass : 3.7/5. Not reach boat product , but u wont feel diff if u use for 3 more daysMusic + sound  + vocals i cant separate in this productDurability :3.8/5 bcoz they used toy plastic in band, but however not easily breaks, compare to boat 450 its strong onlyOverall i look for a aux + type C + best bass effect, so at last above all are not reach my concern😆, now i ordered zeb bang pro(699)rsIf it also sound loud thing, then i shutdown with boat 400 (900rs) segmentNote: if i get boat 660 in initially , i wont go for these alllllll). Bcoz unbeaten and full fil my all expect thanknu😊,Sound quality is good, built quility is ok as per pricing . I got it for 600 rs totally worth it. Its been more 10 days since i am using. Its working totally fine.,Sound and other qualities are doing well except ear cuffs are getting detached easily and no firm support for them,Pons-They are good for the price they come. Sound is decent.Battery life is long enough for 2 days (not countinously).The wired features is a charm if battery goes dead. Noise cancellation is also decent.Coming to the bad points.Build Quality is a  little Cheap according to the price , the hinges shouldn\\'t be used that much it will lose it\\'s grip.Also the Bluetooth is not that grt , if you are on a vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any song.The connectivity is a issue. The dual connect is good but their is a latency of about 2-3 second when switching from one to another.That\\'s all, You can buy this if your budget is less and as a student this is the best headphones at this price range.,Sound :* Great Bass* Vocal and Instrument Seperation : Average ( To be expected like this for this price)Connectivity :*Fast BT connection.*BT disconnects when AUX connectedComfortable to wear since its over the earAverage build qualityOverall 4/5,I like this product. I use it everyday while travelling to college far away places.,If you are getting this product within 1000 rupees then it is a good product for you. ☺️,It is overall a nice product Comfortable keys and smooth typing,Good,Average,Ok,,nothing to say...,good,So the space bar was just horrible, zero response from both side of the key and had to press hard in the center part as well, and the minus key on the numpad was not working at all, you just can\\'t use a keyboard with a space bar like this. for 17\" it might be too small. also it\\'s wobbly. was good enough for not making me return it,If you own gaming laptop and want some elevation for those fans it\\'s not a bad purchase but the temperature is not much but good for eye level,As it has simple design it may not block air flow but it will not comfortable if you use laptop\\'s keyboard as it will start shaking as it doesn\\'t provide such stability and so it is nor usable for typing purpose you must have to use external keyboard and mouse,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cbMITZDRL._SY88.jpg,Good,Works as expected, small form factor,Under slightly rough usage Bottom pads came off but still works as expected,Quality productBest to buy,Good I am using it from 1 month, it works decent.Size is bit small, so it does not provide a good ergonomic.As they say clicks are noiseless, that is not true, button press sound is there.Overall it\\'s considerable and worth buying it.,Like,Light weight and work well,Good,Hands down, logitech is the best in mouses. But I am finding an issue with the scroller. On some days, all of a sudden, the scroller isn\\'t smooth. I have no clue why. I am not able to scroll smoothly with it.,Good battery life, no noise. Good for normal routine usage,M221 is a very good product from Logitech. this is 2nd wireless mouse I bought from them. I bought this product on 1st July 2017 and I\\'m writing this review as my left click is going kaput. Everything is good about this mouse except the battery part. I use this mouse 12-15 hrs a day and I had to change its battery every 2nd month. so those who are buying this product should also buy a rechargeable battery and charger. This mouse is only meant for general work and a bit of casual gaming [ small games]. If you try to play those Triple AAA games you will feel the lag.,Good I am using it for 14 days now. The experience is pretty good as of now. Picture quality is also not bad. Don\\'t expect something out of the world at this price point. But you can go for it if you have a tight budget.,Initial impressions: works as said, glad I didn’t go for cheaper options (not that it’s too costly) just plug and play. Will update if it screws up,The hdmi cable is good to watch movie,sports and its gives better quality while connecting your laptop with TV and play 🎮.I loved it,Works as expected. Length of the cable is short and it was mentioned also satisfied my requirement. If you need more length better look other options.,All good,It\\'s the best HDMI cable at this price range. No problems yet. Just go for it !!,I was expecting this to be delivered on time and it was delivered on time.Product is good as i have tried other cables and wires from Amazon basica brand.,Good one First Of all, the item looks good attractive. The front and back side covers are good, feels smooth and premium. I give it a 4 star considering the below points..Also, Thanks to Amazon for Superfast Delivery.1. Paper quality - nice, I used Ball pens, Sketch pens and also inkpens. all cases no soaking of ink.2. Binding - Spiral Binding and qality is good and attractive.3. Sturdiness - Here it could have been a little better, considering the price tag.4. Light Weight - Binding and Paper quality is nice, still lite weght. That\\'s a Plus.5. Writing Experience - Better than average available notbooks in similar pricetag.,First off, the notebook design is great, pages are nice and smooth, but a bit on the thinner side. The subject dividers are thicker than other pages.The QC has some issues, as of the one unit i ordered for testing this product @118 rs some pages were folded up from the corners and become larger when unfolded as depicted in the picture above. Many pages were glued onto each other hence, tearing some part when flipping them again, illustrated in the picture added above.Its an absolute steal deal for rs 118 per piece as no other notebook competes in the spiral bind 300 page market, and notebooks of about 200 pages non spiral bound of a simillar size are sold for @84 rs as of writing this review.The only downside I found besides the QC is that it doesn\\'t include an index page, otherwise; it has some games, riddles and a notes pages like other notebooks and the first page is dedicated to the owners details and contact N.O. Great to see it present.Overall i recommend this product because of the value for money and the quality. I understand my unit was a one off as other reviews don\\'t seem to mention this. Will update after using this for a few more weeks,The product is worth the money. The paper quality was good and it has six separations for six different subjects.,Valu for moneyPremium quality,,I ordered 3, only one copy was a bit damaged from the binding.,I got all the same design notebook. Which is Little disappointing me. Except that everything is fine!,Good product Best wishes,brought it online as cautious about buying offline coz of fake and overpriced products. using it for my wifi camera. working fine,Nice product,Nice quality product easy to use. Thanks amazon,Well known brand ..Nice product.,Good,worth product,Bahut achcha laga Raha hai Packing was not good, over all good product..,Scroll wheel is very small otherwise the product seems good at least at the first use,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615o-xCWE-L._SY88.jpg,Ok,,A bit disappointed with on/off switch.. it’s too tiny .. otherwise product is nice ..,Gave -1 Star for the flimsy top cover and on/off button. Rest all is good. Easy to navigate. On OFF button at the bottom could have been better. Not the regular type of putting the battery at the bottom part. Pull the Top cover and place the battery. the slot is given for the wireless adapter adjacent to the battery compartment. Easy to use. simple plug-and-play. For better results, switch off the mouse only during weekends. draining of battery power to some extent is fine when compared to the clumsiness of the small on/off button.,Good to use. The quality of this batteries are really good. I used this batteries in wireless mouse and trimmer. In wireless mouse the batteries lasts for more than 7 days and in trimmer it lasts for 15 days. Happy with the product and happy with the packaging and delivery standards of amazon.,Too useful. Good for normal usage. I am using it for my point and shoot camera and it works pefectly well,Worth buying prodect,Good product.,Remote control n longevity,Working well for my camera external flash. I took almost 50 photo with various flash power, and it had still charged. Then I charge it again with Panasonic c55 charger and it was fully charged within 1.5 hours. But when I charge it for the first time batteries were talking too much time, though company claim its pre charged, one battery took 2 hrs to fully charge. May be one cell is weak and I got 2021 packaging.Till now only negative I found that batteries becoming too much hot while charging.,It is powerful batteryFor Muse Usage is coming upto 1 Month after full rechargeFor Key Board Usage is coming upto 1 Month after full recharge.. Medical Equipment are getting Long Time...WALLClocks are only eating Battery Life within TWO Week.But DON\\'T USE for  KIDS TOYS every 2 days you have RECHAGE your Battery.. it is also beatiful and efficency instead of buying new battery ....all other Electronic Devices are it is ok for easier life...,Super batree... Good life Definitely isn’t as good as the original cord but works. Fast charging and pretty sturdy,Worth it,So I had a faulty cable. I was lazy and have a lot of money so instead of calling Apple I bought this for like 300 bucks. Didn’t expected much but for my surprise, this cable actually works and has fast charging. JUST GO FOR IT,Felt quite sturdy, the connectors look premium and were easy to insert. I used this cable to switch all my data from iphone 7 to an m30s. Cable worked like charm while using smart switch app, all my data including whatsapp data was transferred successfully. Satisfied with performance.,Just good,Quality is very goodWorking smoothly.. using same portronics pd charger,This is a real fast charging cable that is serving the purpose,Very good Review after using it for about a month -pros-• battery backup is the most amazing of all.• sound quality is amazing but bass is on the low side.• build quality is well made almost feels premium but could be improved.• very comfy even after a long day use.cons-• There\\'s a noticable delay in touch controls (most irritating one).• There\\'s no such thing as no delay during gaming on wireless earphones. just get wired instead of this if you are planning on using it for gaming.• Noise cancellation calling or enc doesnt work, also while calling 2nd person most of the time says that \"I can\\'t hear you well\" or \"Your voice is so low\" on outdoors.• Sometimes a earphone doesn\\'t turns on, so I have to manually turn it on.• To pickup a call one tap, but here\\'s the catch to disconnect a ongoing call I have to double tap on the touch panel. (boat says single tap tho)Conclusion - If you have a little more budget, don\\'t buy this. else this just works fine.,I recently purchased the boAt Airdopes 181 in-Ear True Wireless Earbuds and have been using them for the past week. Overall, I am satisfied with the product. The earbuds are comfortable to wear and have a good fit, and the sound quality is impressive for the price point.However, I was disappointed to discover that the earbuds do not have noise cancellation as advertised. While they do block out some ambient noise, they are not as effective as other earbuds I\\'ve used with noise cancellation technology.The battery life has been satisfactory. The earbuds last for a good amount of time on a single charge, and the case is convenient for charging on the go.Overall, I would recommend the boAt Airdopes 181 earbuds for those looking for a budget-friendly option with good sound quality. Just be aware that they do not have noise cancellation.,I am writing this review after two days of usage.1. Sound Quality: The lows are good and pleasing to the ears. Bass quality is good. I just felt like the treble is a little too high which makes the high frequency music sound a bit unpleasant. Overall the quality is okay but not as good as a wired headset or neckband earphones. (Kaam chal jayga)2. Battery Backup: It\\'s been 2 days and I haven\\'t charged it yet....still showing 70+% of battery remaining. So I don\\'t think battery backup would be a problem. (moderate usage)3. Built: The case is small and handy. It feels sturdy. The buds fit well in the ears. Overall built is good.4. Latency: This one\\'s for gamers. I am actually impressed by the low latency it has. Even without turning on the \\'Beast Mode\\', the feedback is almost instantaneous. And after turning on the Beast mode, it becomes flawless. I played BGMI and COD and didn\\'t feel any lag in the sound.5. Calling: I tried calling in a silent atmosphere and there was no problem faced. Will update you guys if there turns out to be a problem when calling in a crowded area.,In 1399 rupees it is a good earphones. Good battary life, good sound, good connectivityCons- very poor build quality, feel so cheap. If you r a choosy person then you don\\'t like the product.,If you\\'re looking for wireless earphone under 1500 go for it. This product is good the sound leakage is there no doubt but you won\\'t feel any sort of distortion,the airdrops 181 are very handy, compact in size ,long lasting battery for its size and the connectivity is is pretty good along with the sound quality , though it has a room for improvement in noise cancellation but still performs very well for this price point.,Its a good product sound quality is also agood but noise cancellation is average,It is good product but only for 4-5 months. ***This is the Update MARCH**.I want to make a huge point to anyone who doesn\\'t get good distance, may I suggest purchasing either of the extension cables because they are what I use and they work great,FEDUS USB 3.0/2.0 Male A to Female A Extension Cable  orStorite 2 Pack USB 3.0 Male A To Female A Extension Cable.I have my extension cable from the laptop USB port hanging from the tubelight and this increased my BT range to 25-50 feet radius.

Is there a difference in SBC/aptX? I cant really tell in audio quality but the connection IS more stable. Also, I have not discovered a way to switch between SBC/aptX like Smartphones. It automatically connects as aptX.*******SOME HEADSETS may not work properly--->*******My Brandnew Tribit QuietPlus 72 Headphones DID NOT work well at all.

Sometimes if I stop the video app and restart then it will be no lag.I don\\'t use ZOOM,Teams,Skype, so I cannot test how the mic setup would function.Any one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it. This would be helpful to alot of people.*FIRST post* So for a few months I was using it strictly thru Win10 utilizing Win10 drivers and bluetooth connection page thru Settings/System. But a few times i tried to use with music streaming to Sony XB400 or Oneplus Buds Wireless Bass edition and there would be intermittant drops. Also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my HP AMD A6 chipset laptop. Also anytime I took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive. So I assumed it was a throttling going on with my USB ports. I have Sandisk Dual Drive, WD Passport, DVi to HDMI and Logitech dongle. So one by one i disconnected everything and left the BT dongle and it was a little better.So I checked the TP Link India site for any FAQ related. When I searched in the Downloads->Drivers section there was software driver present.  So I downloaded, installed it and Win10 taskbar shows BT icon to use theBT Dongle. The Driver software is by CSR Harmony Wireless Software Stack Version 2.1.63.0.Once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the BT icon in taskbar. The BT icon sits in the system tray as before. Audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono. Also if your playing a video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo. It works really well, I purchased a long usb male to female cable and now i have a little bit more increase in connection distance. I have not tried this for transfer of files. If and when I find a need to do so I will update.for now, at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my BT audio gear instead of purchasing a more expensive unit to give my laptop BT capabilites. and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives. Oh and I also purchased a seperate QZ Powered USB hub for my drives. So the only USB devices connected are the Dongle, and the hub. Now when I disconnect the BT dongle my drives stay connected.I hope this information is helpful, I tried not to make it too long but it happened. If any questions arise please drop me a line and I will respond with whatever help I can give.,TP link products usually work well...while longevity with continuous use may vary, but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous use..I have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters, routers, range extenders, etc..Now I have tried this Bluetooth adapter..Pros:-Minuscule size, you can keep attached to the device, not noticeableBut not recommended to do so..as it\\'s usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent range..so if one is too skeptical, might lead to security issues.. although the hacker will have to be in the same house probably!Range is decent..works good in the same room..this kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity, usually without barriers...I use it to connect headphones to the PC and it works nicely for that..I earlier had a Bluetooth 2.0 adapter from enter and that worked well too, except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increased..so some choppy audio did occur with today\\'s high quality audios and that got managed with this Bluetooth 4.0 adapter..nice clean audio..Lastly, it works nicely with Linux..i use debian based Ubuntu..and its almost plug and play..I did have blueman Bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter I had.. And when I plugged it in..i didn\\'t have to do anything else..So unlike what the site says, about only windows, it definitely works with Linux..I can\\'t say if the 5.0 version UB500 will work though...While installing the driver in windows, I noticed it was installing CSR stackAnd CSR original chip ( there are many fake ones) is known to work with Linux..so maybe that\\'s why it worked well..Coming to windows, i have win7.I had bluesoleil pre-installed, and it worked with it.Didn\\'t have to install any driver separately..But there is a driver available in their site for xp/7..In win8 and above, it\\'s supposed to be plug and play..So no issues there..Now the cons:-A bit high price than rest of the companies.. probably can improve on that....i bought it for 400Audio quality is good, but somehow, compared to my enter Bluetooth 2.0 stack..The audio was a bit muted..had to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudness..but even then, i feel, a slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio.. no idea if that\\'s a software or hardware issue..encoding/decoding issue..It\\'s not very noticeable.. specially of someone doesn\\'t have anything to compare with..Lastly, the windows driver is 400 MB!granted it has both 32 and 64 versions..but each one is almost 200 MB!Thats way to big for a driver of these devices..Neither bluesoleil/blueman cross 30MB..So I don\\'t know what is being packaged in those drivers..Also, somehow the driver didn\\'t have a clean install in my system, something to do with incorrect loading of c++ library...It didn\\'t matter as I already had another driver installed..Overall a nifty little device.I have no need for 5.0 Bluetooth as i don\\'t have any device that requires it..I just needed a 4.0 adapter to solve the bandwidth problem..and that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpful..Does the job well, few consHence one star less..,Using it for 2 weeks. Just plug it , install drivers and you are good to go ! Seem less connection with ps5 controller! Latency is very low around 1ms . So basically connection is even faster than wired connection (2ms) .  But when I simultaneously connect airpods gen 2 the sound output was very weak , it was muffled! But it serves my main purpose with ps5 controller .,Apparently, it seems like its the most relevant Bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that, generally comes in a BT adapters I\\'d say the only con is the installation part it took a while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub500 aside from this everything is fabulous.,Very easy to install, connectivity is also good but sometimes while using Bluetooth earphones sound cracks also Bluetooth sharing is quite slow .....that\\'s all*Otherwise th product is very good*,1) Easy to install, I mean just plug in .2) Connectivity is on all point but 1-2 time i feel fumble issues.3) sound quality is all depends on your wireless speaker.,If you are tight budget, it\\'s okay then. Otherwise if can spend 150/- extra, go for BT 5.0 version. Much better in both range and connectivity.,Like Loosing charging cable of apple is costly affair. This wire was great purchase made to correct it,Worked well for six months that’s it, now it’s stopped working, now planning to buy one more because the price has come down to 150,Very good product. Compatible with  iPad 2nd generation  and charging very well. Quality of the product is very good and also works fine. Totally worth for its price.,Product is super,I\\'m using from last 6 month. Till now it was good functioning. Now I noticed phone gets disconnected at multiple occasions. might be cable may be damaged.Overall worked well for 6 month.,Takes 5-6 hours to charge full.,Good item. Value,It is the best product I have used till now. I think it\\'s value for money.Speed Test# Read speed  USB 2.0 : 80-90 MB/s  USB 3  : 85-95 MB/s  USB Type C : 85-95 MB/s# Write speed  USB 2.0 : 20 MB/s  USB 3  : 21-25 MB/s  USB Type C : 20-25 MB/sPros:-* Metal body and not heavy* easy use* have type c* good qualityCons:-* product gets very hot while it\\'s connected  (because it is a metal body)* We are not getting the speed that they said.,I like the metal body and build quality but at the same time it is metal so it heats a lot and speed is good it reaches 140-145 Mbps write speed when it is cold when it gets hot the speed get low as to 8 Mbps and storage not good i purchased 128gb varient and I got only 115gb 15gb less storage.Overall decent Product.,1)Heat alot as it is metalic2) Speeds are not consistent somtime it give 20Mbps speed and sometimes 5-15 mbps.3) I can say it is value for money for those who want a pendrive with type c connectorNote- I preferred metal because it is durable,you can also buy it\\'s plastic varients both are same in speeds.Also plastic heat less,Pendrive is quite good. For write operation i am getting 10-15mbs, it heats up more when we perform r/w operation for a long time continuously. When we plug in mobile and then in pc i am getting some kind of error but files are intact and able to copy it,I like it\\'s designe speed and build quality but there is a negetive point after you flip side for 10 to 20 time you will find that tha flip cover is starting to get loose,So far so good, it\\'s early to right a review, as per my usage i will update accordingly,Good,user friendly Good fit, nice smart watch in this price range, especially for  those who need only basic features . I bought grey color,It\\'s been long I\\'m using this now. It has no issues. The battery, touch screen, bluetooth connection every thing works fine. I was looking for something simple and I got this.,Nice design and functionsCan\\'t connect to Whatsapp and other social media app 👎,The modes in the watch are good. The UI sucks. Responsiveness could have been better. Battery life is moderately upto 3-4 days if worn constantly. Colour of the band is a bit faded too.,My new bill provide,Activity Record, sleep tracking is Good.,I bought it for my wife and she was very glad.,Good This eliminates the need to buy chargers for the new USB-C charging cables.The adapters tend to heat up while charging with Samsung fast charger.,Good product,Value for money,It works worth the money,Value for money,Its continuously play a beep sound while connected to the laptop, which is irritating.,Nothing to complain!,Good product but finish could have been still better.As of not working fine but doesn’t look much durable. A lot of people rate this product low as there cud be other underlying reasons for catridge not working, the seller is giving 7 days return policy enough to test the catridge,Good,Quality is good,,Better than refill cartidge,HP original ink Cartridges for HP Printers are always the best and the safest way to go!,Too pricey,Easy to install, perfect fit for the mentioned printers. But its expensive,Good Sound quality is ok, noise cancellation is not Upto the mark, volume is good. Overall for the price it’s worth product. The cushion on the mic comes out easily , couldn’t have been fixed properly,Good,The built design is ok for the product. Everytime i wear and do the resizing my hair gets stuck in the band which is irritating. Rest sound and all is good👍🏻,I stopped using it after continuously using for 3 hrs for office use. It can not be used for long duration calls or back to back meetings. Ears starts paining after 2-3 hours use. Speaker cover is very thin. I will give this device to someone needy.Sound quality and built quality is nice but comfort is huge issue with this device due it\\'s tight overhead band. It keeps both sides on ear for getting better sound or noice cancellation. But the one who is looking for noice cancellation will buy over ear bigger headphones.I use all types of headphones, over-ear, on-ear, earbuds. Earlier used Sennheiser on-ear headphones but it never gives pain.Ideally if anyone buying on-ear simple headphones then it is for calls or meetings where they still want to hear sound in their room. Some attention to sound in your room, for example keeping an eye on kids while being in meeting. Basic padding or multiple layer soft covers for on-ear will be helpfull.Guys go for iBall rocker over-ear or HP over-ear wired headphones for long duration office calls. It cost less compare to this Logitech device.However this is still good buy for upto 60 mins use for 1 session/call/meeting and then a break. Only issue for people having back to back meetings.,Nice quality,I bought this because I had to work from home and had to take calls. My only worry was the noise cancellation because I live next to a busy road. And I am happy with the purchase as the noise cancellation is working great. People on the other side of the call have never complained about any kind of background noise. The plastic quality used is great and it\\'s not squeaky. The wire is long enough. The sound output is good enough, but I don\\'t intend to listen any music on these. If you need something for music then this is a wrong product.Con: The cushion is not adequate and starts hurting the ear lobes within 5 mins. I had some extra cushions so I added those over the ear piece.,Build quality is not that good but sound quality,noise cancellation is best in the range of less than 1000.,After covid-19 our life changes a lot. Online meeting, conferences, webinar, even online classes became new normals. In this situation a good headphone with mic is necessary for doing work flawlessly and this headphone has everything which i needed.1) Audio quality is good and crystal clear without any additional noise2)Mic is also very good with good noise cancellation3)Thanks to amazon for their service and ontime delivery. Getting early delivery for the product was bit urgent for me and it was delivered in almost 6 hour after placing order,I am fully satisfied with the product highly recommend for students and working professionals who have limited budget,you wont regret it. :)4. Only thing i am missing is volume control on headphone I generally don\\'t write reviews on Amazon. But this product is worth every penny.Amazing Product1. It is sturdy2. Good heavy-quality metal is used yet still lightweight and portable.3. Can be easily carried in 1 hand4. On Full Open, total Height reaches 5ft 9in (so can even cover if there\\'s a stage)After buying this, I even surveyed the local market, I can now confidently say I have invested in the right product.There are products available for 1,000 Rs, but paying another just 500Rs for such a quality product is a better decision (Keeping in mind long-term use).,Its been 1 yerar 3month i am using the stand fr my video shoots ... Either its indoor or outdoor ..the stand is so strong and so many option to manage your stability and angle.. Even its so handy that often i use it just holding it like a gimble (though it do not stabilize the video) but i am very use to of it bcs of its  compact look...Go fr it... You will not regret 🤞🏻,Likes:Robust, durable, very well assembled.Dislikes:Due to strong built up, and bigger in size it is difficult to record video of the downside part as tripod legs come in the picture along.As mentioned in the product details, phone holder not included. I purchased a new one alongwith this product. However, there was one phone holder given in the Tripod Box. Due to this false detail, I had to purchase one more phone holder which is under non-returnable products category and is to be kept now.,Same As shown In PicturesGood And Well StableReally Wanted One for My video shootsMust Have For Camera And SmartphonesThey Say It Doesn\\'t Have phone Holder, But They have Sent One Included, So Don\\'t Order Already One.Thank You Soo Much For That Merchant.,Mastttt,I really like this amazing product. Worthy money buying it. Don\\'t worry about negative reviews.you are worth buying it. Tqs,Ok, I like it 👍👍,Best charging power . I used this cable on note 8 pro mi. Using 8month also fast working.,350 might be a little expensive but physically it’s so good. Feels premium. But power limitation is there it is not suitable for fast charging.,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WnvIUaIwL._SY88.jpg,Best data cable charging fast,Very good quality and good durability,Overall good but need some improvement... I trust this product! Works well with car play!,Very good quality and charging is fine. As good as original,Build quality is awesome, best lightening cable ever seen, better than a official  lightening from \\uf8ffIf ur looking for a cable close your eyes and go for it 🔥 or you can buy a (Amazon basics) one I was using that for past 3 years that a bit a cheaper side, I recommend both these cables had better build quality and value for money,Gr8 product overall,Just loved it, very good charging speed.,,Good quality,it well packed, all sealed coveredthe wire looks of a very good qualityrecommended!!!! It\\'s a china product to be clear. Look and feel is good. Base of the device is little wider, so if you have 3-pin socket points consecutively then ysing the next socket could be difficult.The wi-fi signal strength is good as extender but it reduces internet speed. For example my internet speed is 30 mbps which I get if directly connected to my primary router / network. But if connected through extender it downgrades to 18-19 mbps. Overall okay to use. I would have been happy to see a made in India device as the price is also not very low, but unfortunately India is not manufacturing any.. it seems.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/716UbI+jJjL._SY88.jpg,Single band is an ancient technology.This device will supply only 2.4 ghzThat means 5ghz will not be available in your room where you choose to use this.,It was difficult to use and install at first, after that it’s been working perfectly with great signal strength!,It is a good product valued for money but I think it should be sometimes give low speed,I wish I could have ordered dual band ...But so far it\\'s giving satisfactory service,Working fine,Product is ok but it’s only for 2.4ghz mistakenly got it Compact product to use during travels or even at home. I don\\'t need to search for different items. I can just grab it and use it for multiple purposes. Go for it!,Good for taking notes and reminders in a single pack.,This is especially for those who are used to be more comfortable to be organised.,Nice product,You can carry it with you anywhere.... There is no need to worry about space. You can makea list make a note and absolutely you can re-use it.,Product is good indeed I wanted to buy it for long but it is costly,,Today i received my package and yeah it is really cute.Not fully satisfied with the cover but overall its good. Worth it. It is all in good condition and it also comes with a pen too.  Really recommend you to buy ut. https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6171Cw2IlPL._SY88.jpg,100% genuine and perfect product.,Good,Worth the money as its a fun experience to use instant cam!Product is original with good packaging!,The top most amazing feature is it makes pictures look like the old 80’s.. but one problem is few don’t develop at all.,Nice, as per expectations,This is bad after 1 month,Okay productWorth the purchase. Smart watch is good with proper large displayvoice assistance siri for iphone userscalling facilityface time facilityOne deficiency that you are unable to message or type text in WhatsappIf you have small wrist dont go for it or else its a perfect choice for your loved ones.,This is the first time that i have purchased a smart watch. A good watch for newbies like me with lots of amazing functionalities. Apart from that, this watch is a value for money at this price range. The sleep tracker works decently well, could have been better. We can call directly using the watch, i like that feature well. Need not reach for phone everytime. The screen touch is also well. There are lots of watch faces which you can change to or upload one from your own galary which is a plus point. The product looks exactly as shown in the pictures. The calorie and heart beat tracker are also quite accurate. The watch is a bit uncomfortable to watch at times, but otherwise the straps are good and strong,I have been using this watch since a month and its really great. All features are working quite well and connectivity with phone is also good.Screen quality may be improved.,Actually my smart watch BSW043 Ring 3 is not charging 2 to 3 days. It\\'s off I tired to msg fireballs but it alway say to follow our page on Instagram. And when we follow its shows you their new offers. I don\\'t know what to do now. I just submitted the warranty form.,The watch worked for the 2-3 Months and got switched off automatically and Rear Panel also got opened automatically..,I didn\\'t charge it for 2 days, now after charging also it is not getting on,I have been using this watch since a month and its really great. All features are working quite well and connectivity with phone is also good.,Product quality and look was good but have some issues after few months usage When I purchased this watch, I thought it couple be used to send sms, make calls, access notifications without being connected to the phone. I knew that third party notifications required the phone to be connected to the internet, but I thought the watch could place calls and send texts even if the phone is switched off. The product I ordered can only make calls when disconnected from the phone. Features such as SMS (surprising since this is an LTE version) and notifications (this includes watch apps such as outlook) that require internet are only synced with the watch on e it is connected to the phone VIA BLUETOOTHI did not check other features as the main reason I ordered this watch was accessibility to notifications without phone.,I have been using this since June\\'22. It looks good on the wrist,and has all useful features like calling,reading and replying whatsapp messages.The battery is too low though, I keep it switched off at night(I.e. never used it to track sleep), yet have to charge every couple of days. Plus it gets charged slow.,All features of the watch is good but battery backup is very poor. After full charge it runs 36-40 hours but after average uses it will run 20-22 hours only.,It\\'s amazing with the lte function now I don\\'t lug my phone to the gym!! But the battery life sucks and have to charge twice specially when I use lte ,also it heats for some reason and needs to cool down once in a while that time the watch automatically goes into hibernation and starts after some timePositives areAccuracySleep trackingO2 monitorRemote lte connectionWears amazing on the wristGreat screenNegativeBattery life,Using it for 1 month. Fits well, have wireless charger. You can also charge it from your phone if your phone supports wireless charging. One thing which is common to most smart watches is when you\\'re traveling in bus or car in a bumby road, it will assume you are jogging and congratulate you for completing daily tasks 😄,Charging is too slow, which is to be expected.Unless you have a samsung flagship phone, you won\\'t be able to see camera app on the watch, and you\\'ll have to get third party applications, and they\\'re just horrible.,Product is goodPros1 health accuracy is high2 ui is good3 Design and build quality is also goodCon1 app is not that good and facing connectivity issues,Good HONEST REVIEW :-I got these buds in ₹895/- and I only buy earbuds because of the music, movies, series...MUSIC EXPERIENCE- 4.5/5 (Tbh I like to hear balanced music like crystal clear sound with a balanced bass but yeah if you are bass lover then just think again before buying it)BATTERY - 5/5HYPERSYNC - 5/5BLUETOOTH - 3.5/5 (I checked the box and there it\\'s written Bluetooth 5.3 but its range is low and that\\'s not up to my expectations... But It will work for me...) So yeah if you are just buying it for Bluetooth 5.3... just think again...INSTACHARGE- 5/5 It actually works very well...BUDS- 4.5/5 ( In ear design is good and they fits perfectly also you can do workout, exercise, running etc... but if your own ears are somewhat different like so big then it\\'s your problem Although it comes with different buds sizes so u can try them...;)Buds are really so light so yeah I personally like them...CALLING EXPERIENCE (VOICE/VIDEO CALL) 3.5/5These buds don\\'t come with ANC Mode so please don\\'t buy them just for ANC...And incall range is too low... :(  which I really don\\'t expected... (But It will work for me),The sound quality is good, no doubt. But on a personal note, such buds dont suit my ear. Others who used it liked it though,very bad quality of product. Stop working after 2 months.please dont waste your money on this earbud.,Good sound/ good bass/all features is nice/Good in room or silent place...some background noise come in open area like road... during travel...but this prob in all companies,Like at this price , but noise cancellation is not so good.,Good product for this amount, rarely facing issue while redmi 10,For my listing music and it has great quality,The sound quality is very clear and the range is very good but the bass is not that great I used these for my wireless mouse which is a razer deathadder v2. One of these would last exactly from a week to two. Was weird because I used the mouse same way with each but some of the batteries would die out quicker than expected. Should be fine if you’re using it something less taxing like a wireless mouse,Good,For wall clocks & SC/TV remotes,The batteries delivered in ok condition but can\\'t make out the life or actual price as covered by an external sticker on top of it,Nice,Battery life is excellent as compare to other brands,Nice,Good I was using  JBL C100 SI,  and this time bought JBL C200SI,  and honestly i couldn\\'t feel much difference between this. One common thing about these are the cheap wire quality.  JBL could have address this.,I have used it for listening songs and I can say it is good earphones for that price,Average, expected too much but sound quality is good but bass is not that great. Overall good product,Earphone has good sound quality,Avarage,Nice headphone,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q50WnB0TL._SY88.jpg,Best sound quality. Only issue is the paint coating started pealing off from the head piece and the wire at the connector end chipped off gradually. Good product i am giving this review after 2months of use and i have ha good experience with this monitorThe only problem you may face is the control panel is not user-friendly it is different to operate it.,,Good pics and good gaming all are top in this price range va panel is good.,it\\'s alright as long as you are not expecting musch from it,Worth for money and best for home use. Screen size also good and eye protection is best,quality vis this product is good but after i deal for another order suddenlty price become high 35 %  why ! in just 1 day  , Answer me ! is it jock,Worth monitor this price,Monitor is good if you\\'re not doing heavy graphic design activity, coz display become bit pixallated in dark. I checked this is not issue of my display driver or HDMI out. But image is crisp and good refresh rate for office applications. Good buy at this price, but if you can afford costlier monitor, then look for someone having hight adjustment options. This one not having any. Good,Product is as described, good we can use it,Good for the price,These are not super bright but i like them since small in size and can be folded.Easy to carry when travel and can be used with poerbank.I use it sometimes as night light on my charger facing to ceiling or at wall.,Loved it,Nice one,Worthy product at this lowest price,Good lighting and good quality Still using it , have ordered long time back, easy to use and install,Value for money,Nice,I received a used product first and then wrote in comments for proper quality check of seals not tamperedAmazon did their job in QC and sent me a new product which was sealed and unopenedProduct is good Can charge 2 devices at same timeThis parallel charging will damage the charger Use it only when needed,A good car charger! Must have product. I was using it for the past 3 months, I\\'m charging my phone and car air pump. Working smoothly without any issues.,Good,Good,Good Bahut hi achha product hai badhiya saund and bluetooth connectivity,Build material is plastic body. However, sound was good,Nice,Sound quality is goodBattery performance good,It is a satisfactory Bluetooth speaker and is perfect choice for those who are looking for a budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money. It serves these purpose very well and is not pricey. Why I am saying all this……First things first, I got this at 549 (the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case). 2. My laptop and phone volume  is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience. So here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent, size of speaker is conveniently small, lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome. After a complete charge I used this speaker for continuously for about 6 hours at about 80% volume and still the speaker is left with 60% charge. I cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than 70% charge and I just topped it to full. Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto 10 mtrs. FM reception is average without connecting the data/charging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected. It has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only. First button “M” is mode which when pressed switches from Bluetooth to FM to Aux to Usb/memory card. Transition of switching is flawless. Volume up/down keys are used to change volume and switch the channels. Long press changes the volume and short press/click changes the channels in FM or changes the track via Aux. Most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic. Yes, you can actually use this speaker (when connected to phone) to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues. Voice clarity is very good for the calls made. MUSIC CLARITY IS NOT VERY GOOD. (READ CONS FOR THIS). Quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durable.CONS. Sound quality is just average.  Voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant. But when it comes to music, this speaker struggles to deliver quality. People are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass, but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality. This is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality. But this is manageable and you can ADJUST THE MUSIC EQUALIZERS in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality. This is the reason I don’t consider its music quality a con for the product. There’s one limitation about charging connector to. It comes with a charging port compatible to A/B type connector, so if you have a charger with data cable supporting “C” type connectors, you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only. So you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker. Instead you will have to carry two different cables. This speaker does not come with a charger, so you will have to use your mobiles charger (5v, 1A)  for the purpose. But for the price rage, this seems reasonable.Useful tip for buyers: Most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker. But you can install any of these two apps “Bluebatt” or “Bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level” from the playstore, if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speaker.What you get in complete package: 1 unit of Bluetooth speaker, 1 cable which has Aux connector, USB connector and (A/B type) micro Usb connector, 1 tiny  user manual.Quality of packaging: Excellent, sturdy,  packaging used by Cloudtail to secure the company’s product packaging. Manufacturing date was of May-2021.,I like it,Portability and Bluetooth connection is good.,Awesome 😎👍 Pros -Really like the stylus. It works fine , using it from last two months. Excellent for note taking. Tip quality is good doesn\\'t wearing off. Extra tips provided. It provides all the functions which are mentioned. Charges quickly. Response time is really fast.Cons-Few times it automatically turned off while using, but not a big concern as it happens rarely.Not for professional sketching and drawing as it is clearly mentioned that it doesn\\'t support pressure features.Conclusion -For price under 2k I think it is the best stylus.I am using it with iPad air 5.Didn\\'t face any issues till now so don\\'t know how helpful customer care support is.,So, the quality of packaging and product quality is pretty good. I’ve seen it turn off in just 30 seconds a couple of times but that’s all. By the way, I ordered it for my old iPad Pro 10.5 inch A1701 as I don’t want to buy new Apple Pencil at full price and I somehow couldn’t find the right alternative for 1st gen Apple Pencil either.. but I found some questions here answering it works for A1701.. after delivery, I found out it actually won’t work and then magically the right model of stylus was on my Amazon Home Screen when I wanted to return this. Gonna order a new one which KINGONE says works with A1701. Let’s see..,Very good product build quality is aluminium so feels premium working is good as well best for note taking and basic operations budget friendly .,Full recharge is completed in 18 mins👍 affordable price.👍 Wish Double Tap Gesture as at the apple pencil 2- ND gen.,Ease of use, accurate, all is good upto now and also looks good, feels good, feels premium. Product at this price deserves 5 star,Good product,While using it automatically off\\'s itself this happen when it is in use. But worth buying than a expensive apple pencil ✏, LG was always Good , correct delivery, good service but sound quality was poor. The speakers were fitted below the tv. No clear sound. That was the only problem.,Good videoGood vice,Picture quality is awesome.,Good at that price,Okay product, the OS has lags after about a year of use. This is the best you can get for the price tag it comes with.,I like it,Best one when it comes to bugdet, easy installation and handy features.,Good design of the keyboard and mouse lenght of the wire is short.,Value for money worth it .,Good,NICE PRODUCT,Good for lightweight use. Ocassional gaming can be done .  Uplifted keys.. keep your hands soft while typing.,Although it is quite cheap and works nicely for me, I think this is not for those who look for soft touch keyboard. Keys \\'feel\\' lose and needed to be hit a little harder. Also, the Enter key is upside down compared to most keyboards around. As a result, the \\'\\\\ |\\' key is in the second row instead of the first. Could be irritating for those fast typing guys.,Go for it,Value for money 💸 The headband is really thin, therefore it starts to hurt after 15mins of use, I have wrapped a napkin around it for extra cushion but that doesn\\'t look good if using outside. I wish the comfort level was better,Expected a better product from JBL. The Bass is quite low and has some disturbance also.,Best entry level NC headset with better sound quality. NC is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises. People talking are not canceled, only muted down. Sound is good for the price range(4/5). If you are looking for superior NC, try to buy sony xm4s wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy. The cushions are far too small to fully cover ear, they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage. There was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears. Charging time was around 1 hour. Battery life is so perfect, like u can charge this full and use it for a while week without NC with around 5to6 hrs of daily usage. So final verdict is bang for the bucks. If u r into NC, just go buy xm4s... 🏃,Good quality product,Very good for phone calls.The microphone is excellent. Much better than most Bluetooth earphones.The audio is clear, but the shape of the earbuds fails to direct the audio reliably across different types of ear sizes.JBL tried replicating the Apple earbud shape. Does not fit the ear snugly.Falls off often.,It\\'s a good quality product but battery drains very fast.,ANC is just a gimmick on this one, bass is poor, don\\'t buy if you need bass. Quality is good, looks nice. Comfort wise, the clamping force is a bit tight, if you like the cozy feel, good for gym or running. Sound isolation is good. Earcups are slightly small for over ear, would keep touching the edges of your ears, you may get used to it or not. Besides bass, the sound is good. Battery life and connectivity is good too. Boat has better base and more comfort, but they also fit loose, these fit tighter.,Overall good product but after 4-5 month Bluetooth not working Usable for cleaning tech kits.,Good product at this price,The microfiber cloths were perfect objects to clean my laptop screen. The brush was a bit rough, and the bristles kind of fans out while cleaning and you need to use your fingers to put it back to your original shape every now and then, which is not hygienic. Haven\\'t used the cleaning solution, so cannot comment on that.,Well packaged and the product works great,Everything is nice but brush is not value for money.,Easy to clean laptop and even phone. Travel-friendly products.,Product is good however cloth quality could have better at this price. It is bit costly.,Worthable Update:I returned the drive with money reverted back.Seller was cooperative & reverted without hassle or communication.ABOUT THE BRAND SANDISK :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSanDisk is an Israeli-American manufacturer of flash memory products, including memory cards and readers, USB flash drives, and solid state drives. As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let’s have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term “Ultra” came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5”inches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won’t give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn’t have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MB/s to 15 MB/s if that’s a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesn’t work.@ SPEED (  The de-merit detail )  : I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MB/sec and went down & down to 10-11 MB/sec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MB/Sec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline “Ultra” and mentioned speeds of 130 MB/sec (which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement & not reversal.I know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MB/s -Read & 19 MB/s – write which looked like a mere consolation. Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile & S2 tablet too was not fast.Verdict : Yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as “Ultra-slow”.@ STORAGE : Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough.@ WARRANTY : The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers.@ PRICE : I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, Dual drive & brand image. MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks & it was tagged made in Malaysia. Only if, it was a bit faster.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, Ultra-tagline & modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write rates.Even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. It could have been a great all-rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk & 5 years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,COVERED HERE: Actual storage space, Heating, Mobile Phones, Tight Fitting on mobile phones, Speed, Formatting File System, Value for Money, Free App, Company, Brand, Seller.About Company, Product & Seller:1. SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external hard-disk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable.2. About 3 to 5 years ago, WD Elements & Portable drives of 2TB and 4TB were priced Rs. 1200 less than current day prices. They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon.3. Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon.4. For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. Reason for higher prices for same brand\\'s same capacity storage devices may be various - such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.REVIEW: SanDisk Ultra Dual 64GB USB 3.0 OTG Pen Drive (Gold):1. STORAGE SPACE: Just as in external hard-disk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. SAME AS OTHERS: For the 64GB pen drive, actual storage space available is 57.2GB. This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. This is because it has FAT32 File System. Also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use.- In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT32 pen drive is shown to be 61.5GB. So that\\'s 4GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System.3. HEATING: Even with just 10 minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. This heating does not happen in WD external hard-disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. MOBILE PHONES: The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well.5. TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES: The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones & tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. VALUE FOR MONEY: Even if you don\\'t use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 3.0 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers.7. SPEED: The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop, Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones.8. FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE: Unless you are sure you won\\'t use your pen drive on a particular device, don\\'t format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File System.But For Example, If you have decided that you won\\'t use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don\\'t want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- With your Linux system\\'s file format, you will have better storage space than any Windows File System.- BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it won\\'t work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which don\\'t have Windows Operating System. Same way, if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System, it won\\'t be recognised on Windows laptops, Android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is.9. FREE APP: Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive. It is easy to install and doesn\\'t take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access. It is very useful App with easy user-interface. App takes 64MB storage space on Android Phones.- Features include: cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phone\\'s File Manager App. Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive. Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive and Add MicroSD card storage to manage all your files from just one Memory Zone App. Restore Backup. Copy, Move, Delete, files as well as clean up WhatsApp related files. See available storage space on your phone. See data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10. BEWARE - Users of Memory Zone App should know that they agree to Terms of Use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy - such as illegal copy, storage, distribution of Movies, Music, Software, Books, etc as per DMCA copyright laws then the Company will provide the user\\'s data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners.OVERALL - best product in the market, at best price in Indian market, with features not offered by other companies for similar specs.,Value for money. May be desig can be improve for the sliding and handling,It was good with compatibility and storage of data but its slow in data transfer. It take so much time for moving and copying of files,Good quality,Good Quality product,Pendrive Quality to Aacchi H Par , Storage 64 Gb Ki jagah 61 Gb Hi Milta H 3Gb Kam Milta H par accha hai Original Pandrive Hपेनड्राइव ओरिजिनल हैं क्वालिटी भी काफी अच्छी हैं थोड़ा सा स्टोरेज कम मिलता हैं तीन जीबी का 64 जीबी कि जगह 61 जीबी ही मिलता हैं पर काम अच्छा करता हैं, इस्तेमाल करते टाइम थोड़ा गर्म  होता हैं पर अच्छा काम करता हैं |,Good VFM indoor use (living room/bedrrom) use and clear view upto 120sqft rooms.Configuration is pretty easy for any novice. Night mode is good as well.Only flaw i feel is that the head portion is bulky while its resting stand is not heavy leading to the camera movements if not screwd down.,Best camera impressed me video quality is osome but the app lags,I like it,It is a very compact product that can fit almost anywhere. The only drawback is that most of the features that it offers are cloud based and requires you to pay to avail them.Features like \"rich notification\", where the phone notifications also contain a screenshot when the motion is detected, should have been included as part of free service (at least when connected to the same wifi). As of now, the only free notification that you get is an alert with the date and time the motion was detected and you need to open the app and wait for it to load up before knowing what motion had occured.AI motion detection also should have been a locally available free feature instead of relying on cloud. The normal motion detection is not very perfect and has few false positives.Also, a web UI would have been nice to have instead of relying only on the Tapo app to view and configure the settings.Overall, as a normal ip camera with recording, this is great but most features that it provides requires paid cloud connectivity which was disappointing and it lacks a web UI. Hence,I would recommend that you check other brands before deciding to buy this.,Very good for small shops or indoor for house care,It was definitely not a new sealed product. It looked like a returned product resold to me...it was dusty inside, original stickering worn out etc..  but the product works n i am ok with it.,,Tapo cam is very good and working as expected and 32gb sd card can record upto 3 days and continue in loop mode. We can see person and motion detection events Good,Good product but Bluetooth coverage is poor. Gets disconnected often.,Good product but not comfortable, not fitted properly,I am writing this review after 1 year I have got this headphones it is almost 14 months now the right ear piece is not charging well even if I keep the office in the box for 4 hours 4 to 5 hours like that the charging is very low it\\'s not full it\\'s not getting full so this product last only for 1 year and in this one year the sound quality I can say it is very good but when I use it for so attend the calls the mic is very poor other person really can\\'t able to hear me properly and also lot of noise.,Descent product. I purchased this product on Apr 2022 and still using it without any issues.,My left side one is not working, i reset this as per the manual but still is not working plz help me,I really like it\\'s sound quality and Also the less in the Ear buds. Also bass quality is good but could have been a bit better. Overall this product is an awesome one 4/5 honetsly,For Music its very goodSize is little bigger as expectedCalling quality is above average Works good,Bought it to replace my Phillips QT4005 trimmer\\'s 7yr old  battery cell.Old trimmer battery lost it torque... would not start without smacking it on the hand.Soldering the connections was bit tricky but i got it done by sanding both side surfaces of the new battery cell.New Duracell one does its job..trimmer works now like its supposed to.Its lasts more than 30+ minutes easily.Charges like its supposed to.I am satisfied with it. Saved an electronic device from being obsolete.If you want more performance..maybe get 900mah cell....but for me thats expensive...750mah is enough.Long term performance is to be seen.,Used for my philips trimmer. Gives a backup of more than 4-5 days,Really amezimg performance. I did not expected this much good and long performance. I am using diff company charger still these batteries fit well. And works for months. Good performance in good price,Charging is godd and battery is lasting longer after one charge,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714qCj-ogHL._SY88.jpg,Good,It shows good battery life as of now. This connector has provided as a boon for my old Samsung LCD monitor and I am proactively using that monitor as the 2nd screen just if the finishing of the product can be improved then it would be a better purchase option.,Save it purpose well without any issue. I am satisfied,Working fine,GO FOR IT,It’s works properly good product but poor quality,I buy this product after so many reviews. this product is not so much clear. But it get the job done. you can buy to get display only. not so much clear. but still price is very good compare to other products.,Good,It worked really well for 3-4 months but now it started showing its \"cheap chinese\" side. Display keeps disconnecting randomly and will come back. It\\'s a headache to read/work on external monitor now since it keeps disconnecting the external monitor and then reconnects it. Overall good.,TV picture ok smart betterSound very low another brand,Service provider refuse install my TV, bad service and samsung, I am calling 3 times service provider. Not meet my home address.why ? Bad bad,They product did not come with the support stand or wall hanging hook to install the Tv,Picture quality is very poor in cables,Floor stand does not come with it ... You have to buy it seperately. Request Amazon to cleary mention it in the add . You will have to pay seperate charges for the installation guy to buy the floor mount .,Good, Liked this Product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710C5jPDcrL._SY88.jpg,Purchased for a laptop. Perfectly working,Good,Very good mouse for a budget setup.,usefull . ... gud quality,The good thing about this mouse is that u can remove the scrolling clip attached inside the scrolling wheel and the wheel becomes very smooth to scroll,The Best of this mouse is its quality as per description, its totally worth it, best for professional usage, if searching for gaming also suitable but dont have dpi options, so for advance gaming you can search something else may be logitech g102 best mouse (with dpi options), else  go with this. The watch is good, the app is very bad, no Google fit integration or anything, watch face is barely customisable, I don\\'t know why they used the new noise fit prime app with it, the app is very glitchy.If you want this watch for calling, go for it, otherwise don\\'t, I hope they make this watch compatible with actual noise app.Also, wrist awake does not work properly.On the plus side, it is good for calling.,It is great for the price range. I bought it for my son and he is very happy. Can pair with a phone and make and receive calls. Nice UI, great watch faces, step count looks to be fairly accurate. All in all a good buy.,Just work like a smart watch..,Its very light weight with all the added features. Battery life is Max 1.5 day.It drains your phone charge rapidly,Nice,Like very much,Nice,Comfort and nice to see Paper quality is good. Worth buying...,Delivery was on time, perfect packaging,evry thing was perfect,but the price could have been little lesser of it would have cost around 100-110, it would be the perfect note book , but yeah it\\'s ok price but whatever the premium ness is on the top or I would say more than top🤗,I ordered it for my physics note..... everything thing is good but didn\\'t expected single metal binding......I ordered it for more aesthetic study but it works for me,Very good quality,Paper is somewhat thin compared to other notebooks but everything else is great..,,Quality of classmate\\'s product is always undisputed.Just check for discount and then purchase.,सभी  अच्छा है। Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It\\'s great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item. Still using,Dealing with Amazon was a pleasant experience; the goods were delivered on time and in proper condition. Both the packing and the goods were excellent. It seems sturdy and has enough room for any standard-sized hard disc or external SSD. It is ideal for all types of portable storage devices.,Perfectly fits my HDD and it\\'s wires. Had ample of spce to keep Pen drives and other petite stuff.It\\'s very sturdy and the material is also pretty good.,Case is overall good in terms of quality. Looks smart to carry,Good quality spacious. Actually it hold two of my disk and it’s wire,Value for money, go for it without any confusion. I will update my review after some uses,Good one,Looks good. Quality is also good. I have better sound quality my experience this best mid range budsBass quality goodNoise cancelation also good,Product is very nice. Sound quality is very gud but in calls little bit problem,Good sound quality and bass, great charge backup can play for 6hrs or moreNot recommended for calls and noise cancellationGreat product recommended for buying,Stands both for quality and economy,I like this product was really nice,Material used could be improved and bcz of slide opening buds are getting scratches.,The build quality and sound is good.Nice product with godd sound clarity.,Sound Good,Quality seems to be good. But an issue has been post 4 months from the purchase that one side of the buds is not working. Please look into it. The other reviews say that the volume is too low but it is not at all like that it is pretty good ,For such a small speaker the quality and the volume is very good. It is very easy to carry around . The people who bought JBL go 1 this is an hands down upgradetion would highly recommend .The price is too high but i got it in an offer that is the only -point . The Bluetooth connectivity is fast and very reliable and is completely water proof. Comming to the end it is  pretty much a good speaker but for people with a budget pls try other brands,I love JBL audio products and used many like earphone and headphones but that all products were brought from official website but this time I tried Amazon and it still worth and geniune seller and thanks for him and awesome sound more than expected and clarity and bass andvoice is very punch and not disturb your hear but i noticed that it have very very lite humms wen it turns on the speaker without pairing but not noticable,Bass is ❤️Portable also connectivity is fastCharged is late,JBL Go2 is actually good 👍..but sound quality is not much better, according to price..over all ,good... delivery aur packaging bhi bhot acha hai.💟,Battery level indicator not available,,Good audio but the mic feature is not that good.,Good bluetooth speakers by themselves but bit overpriced. They\\'re not a significant upgrade from the original JBL Go. I have both of them and the sound quality is fairly similar - rather the older speakers sometimes sound better! The signal is too unstable once connect you need a bit of adjustment by unplugging or moving the wire to get a proper signal. But does the job. Go for this if you want to experiment with HDMI as I wasn\\'t sure it would work for me or not. Otherwise go for a good quality breaded cable.,Good product,The cable did not come in a box. There is no box. If this was to be shipped without any packaging or branding, same should have been mentioned. When we pay for hi quality products, we expect a certain quality! I still have no idea if this is a hi speed 4k cable or not.,Good,Bought to connect my CP monitor (CCTV) to MI android TV.. .. OK quality at this price,I give it a 5 on 5, reasons as below..1. Amazon delivery - Super fast, same day delivery within 4-5 Hours.2. The delivery person was good.3.  Robust Built Quality, looks & feels premium.4. It is working excellent, I\\'m using for lapptop to big screen TV connectivity, and could see the undistorted picture and sound, nicely doing its work.A few words of cons..1. Feels a little hard to adjust and bend as per requirement, less flexible. But this may not be a serious concern.Overall a nice experience so far.,Good job,Like. The edges may start gapping out, but overall quality (including touch sensitivity) is good, as for the price tag.,The packaging was very nice. There was a microfibre cloth in the box, though it was basic ,I liked it. Now the main product, it was just perfect in size. Installation process was quite simple. But tempered glass is very fingerprint catchy. In harsh lighting the fingerprints could be noticed easily.,Product is otherwise good, but attracts too much visible finger impressions during routine use with a clean hand.,,Quite easy to install,Very easy even for beginners,,Installation was smooth After installing it screen is responsive n does what it is for good gamepad, could\\'ve been better in ergonomics cos after a while, the grip starts aching. also comes with Haptic vibration feedback which is great for the price,Gamepad is very good and it\\'s working also good. Worth to buy.,In terms of bulid quality it\\'s plastic and you know it beforehand, there\\'s a silicon grip patch which is nice but the grip-feel will be worn off after use and you\\'ll be left with a shiny and slippery patch.Feels sturdy in-hand but personally I used it to play many games, mostly FIFA and the keys stopped working after certain time due to the silicon layer under keys.Even though I wasn\\'t using it aggressively then too it didn\\'t last 3 MONTHS.I was hoping for better performance but sadly that wasn\\'t the case, the Joystick (gear) itself was precise but R2 L2 triggers was not working as they should be after 1.5 months even after many failed attempts to calibrate.,This gamepad is working good with pc, tv and mobiles too if you have an OTG. One of the best and affordable gamepad. Go for it,liked it,Posting review after more than 100 hrs used.First of all I buy this gamepad to check experience, it is amazing vibrations lights are good, Build quality is awesome its better than I expect, we can adjust vibration intensity depending on games best for Racing and sport kind games, but honestly if you are more into fps or shooting kind of games Our Keyboard and mouse are best to feel in game.The reason I used Wired is it comes with very good length and that is enough to enjoy the game, that why I din\\'t waste extra money for just remove wire.,nice console.,Good product It\\'s little small for big hands. But best available in the market.,Good product, but too smaller than the regular one!,Hello everyone,I bought this Mouse in April 2022, so after 8 months of use, I\\'m writing this review.Battery (the most important one): 10/10 - It came with a single AA-sized battery (Clock battery) that worked from 1st April -  10th December which is more than 8 months.  Even though my usage was heavy (6 hours average per day) in a corporate job day of 9 hours.Look 7/10-  Amazing with beautiful curves. Though battery closing pane could have been better.USB transmitter: 9/10 - It\\'s normal and can be carried inside the battery cavity.Switch: 5/10 - On/OFF switch is not handy, you need a long nail to switch it ON/off but is strong enough to resist a hard stroke when you force it to off with your nailless fingers.Precision and laser: 10/10: Precision is just what most mouses have which is accurate and the Laser is invisible (No annoying light in the bottom).Buttons: 7/10 - Buttons produce a slight noise on click and after a long usage the Left button is shaking slightly.Overall ratings: 9/10The main reason for you to buy this: Its battery efficiency, it will cost you only 12 INR  for 8 months.,Its very small and it trouble for my hand which is considerably smaller than other people it do fit nicely in 10 year old nephew but now mine but no complains works great from far distance  so its good there its should be sold for 400/ only its slighly over priced,Nice mouse.Easy to holdWorking very smooth and fast, response time is very good.,Good durable product,Its a great mouse under this price for normal office use, it would have been much better if it had silent clicks!!!!!,Working well so far. A 10bucks piece can save cable worth hundreds. Totally recommend,I just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors. Specially, apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesn’t last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear.This seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear&tear. Have applied in earphones also. Will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life.Till now, feeling good about this useful product.,Price is high,You can go for this.,It is useful. After using it, the durability of the cable is good.,Very good product it definitely protect your cable,It doesn\\'t really protect your cable if the cable is starting to wear out. You need to use this before the cable starts wearing out. It works only if the cable is thick enough. But overall good quality.,Good The router won\\'t turn on, requested for replacement.Update: the replacement router is working fine. Judging by the condition of the boxes, I probably had received a refurbished item the first time around.,Good product for home use,After 2 months, it is working nice and fine.,Good 👍,Very compact,This router is super easy to install and you can hang it on the wall as well. It comes with 3 years of warranty and the size of the router is very small and despite of that it gives good signal to the adjacent room.,Go for it, It is Good Product.,Working good The keyboard and mouse are good for typing and normal use. Cannot comment about battery life since I\\'ve used it only for a month. Sometimes mouse did not respond when laptop got hot while gaming . Hence not using the set for gaming.,Product is very good but I have issues with the packing.The outer plastic bag was fine but the Amazon packing box(brown) was broken.The product box and the product was fine. Mouse battery lid is little bit loose otherwise good.,Product is Good. i have got defective product first and i have option for replacement and the same day my product was replaced. overall the product is smooth and easy to use,No caps lock light  button. It must be there for entering passwords.,All good except tiny dongle which we loose many times.,The keyboard is really good, the travel is incredible (especially when you’re coming from an ultrabook keyboard).Packaging: No cover. Nothing. Just the box, which was literally torn with visible brown cardboard insides. Yikes!,Good, Price is high,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71ZRGtYWBAL._SY88.jpg,Nice,Stand is given in curved  shape bench unable to stand sturdy it is falling be careful while using laptop,Value For Money,Easy folding. Convenient to user. Working place is little bit congested and the stability is horrible. Though user friendly. Like this product.,It is good but please sell spare parts also like stand  lock and all the things,I like it Very good,Nice product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71M+sT3c-iL._SY88.jpg,simple and handy for travel purposes and use at office.,Nice,Good calculator but i think price is high as compared to market,Writing review after one month usage. Very good quality and worth the money. No issue till date. Go for it,It is working fine.I like it. This was a saviour for me as I didn’t want to buy expensive stylus and max dont work with Iphones. It’s not too precise but it gets the job done. I love it,Unexpectedly this product works very well. But When I buy this, the spare disk was missing.,This item is simple awesome for this price. It is doing good without any glitches and worth buying for the price amazon is offering.,Though it is good but the tip of the stylus pen should be umbrella free....no handle grips too.,There is a delay between writing and also I get wrong color i ordered bluse and I get gray,this is a good digital pen for digital art work and very smooth working techniques using so easily,Works perfectly on Samsung S22 Plus. I often use it for video editing too. But I think it\\'s overpriced. I got it for Rs. 389 including delivery charges. It should cost max upto 250. 2 stars have been cut for overpricing.,It is definitely worth the money tho it does give some scratches it\\'s not that see tho so it\\'s fine for it\\'s price light weight If you are using a seperate mouse go without cup holder it\\'ll give you some space otherwise it\\'s fine for even 15 inch laptop. It\\'s strong and sturdy but it should be 350 to 400 not 599.,Everything is perfect - the sturdiness, the color, the finishing, the height, the weight. The only con is that it can be a little shaky if you use it on the bed.,The table is lightweight and less durable but it serves it\\'s purpose.it\\'s a good product for its price don\\'t expect too much.,Product is good but  price (569 rs) is little more higher than over all quality of product and also there is no logo of amezon basics,It\\'s good,I think the mobile/tablet holder is useless,Material is of good quality and product is worth for money. It would be nice to have a lock mechanism so that stands doesn\\'t tend to close once placed in surfaces like bed.,The table is very strong. Will not break easily.But its legs are not stable at all. If you keep laptop on it and is not supported, then the whole table will fall sideways. It happened twice to me. Using it to connect my type C Plantronic headphones to Dell laptop and it’s working fine.,We like this product it is just amazing,support good charging speed.,Nice,Small yet very good accessory for the car. It is very small in size and becomes a part of the car interior.There is no lag in supplying the power and gives an ease to connect phone with USB C type on a USB A port.If you are looking for a good converter then this is it.,Annoying advertisement of asking you to give 5 star rating is in the packaging box of this product.,It is very helpful in charging phones in old cars.  I am using an old car and it only has USB -B Ports. And I am using it for some power banks also...,I had an unused cable c to lightning port but was not being used. I ordered this product and it turn out to be miracle for me now i can use my unused cable with this product. GOOD PRODUCT 👍👍 I use it for writing messages or drawing.. the only con is it reflects light and brightness is less.. so nothing is visible when lights are out... But its very smooth and easy to use.... I like it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71S0PtuMUUL._SY88.jpg,For the price it’s great. A erase and different ink. Poor functions would have completed the package.,,It might be the result of adding additional materials for durability or longetivity - who knows but the pen-strokes you\\'ll see be a little \\'leaky\\' and thicker.,Disadvantage:Build Quality is very poor - light weight Plastic finishing.If Children handles the product more carefully.Brightness very poor.Skin or finger touch also writing the LCDAdvantage:Price is valuableLock button is useful One,You can always trust Amazon basics. Got it yesterday and the quality and feel is good.,Useful one for kindergarten students Quality of the material is not that good. If it falls then it will break in parts easily but overall it is easy to use and speed of the ports is fast.,Manufacturing quality is quite poor. Even a small movement can cause the second device to get unplugged from the USB port, which is not at all strong.,Its  cheap on multiple levels, first ad foremost money wise and then most importantly quality wise. Used it for 2 weeks and the casing came off and i cant seem to click it back into place, it works(for the time being) so im just waiting for it to die now. but for 180 rupees what else can we expect.,Built in quality is not so good, it\\'s very sensitive,,It is not tiny, but small enough not to clutter my desk. Cord length of about 1.25 to1.5 ft is nice. USB ports work well. The only negative point that is glaring is the poor finish. However, for the price, a good buy,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719wdleO76L._SY88.jpg,Packaging was damaged, seems to be a some one has used and returned this item. I really like this product. Gifted to my sister, and she likes it,Great ⌚,Good product,Nice 👍,Thik hai,In this price range it\\'s ok product,Color so nice..I loved it,Need some more features:( Dissapointed in the microphone,4/5,don\\'t buy for calling purpose.. voice not delivered properly to hearing other side.. you should by best earphone in local market.,I\\'ve been looking for a good pair of earphones with type C as my phone now comes without a 3.5 mm jack sadly. (Pixel 6a).Unfortunately Indian markets doesn\\'t have much of budget USB C earphones as it\\'s extremely limited in availability so my search gotten narrowed down to this one.Pros:+ Works okayish for the price.+ Sound quality: Average+ Call quality: fairly good. I didn\\'t had much complaints from the other side during phone calls. Tested when riding bike also, there were some wind noises reportedly. But still does the job.+ Buttons: works well. Haven\\'t noticed any niggles thus far.Cons:- definitely not recommended for audiophiles as there\\'s no distinction between highs, mids and lows. Sound quality gets muffled if volume raised above 70%.- bass is not that good. It\\'s there, you can feel it but it\\'s not adequate and gets muddles out if the volume raised. Pls make use of your Eq app (Poweramp Equaliser app, in my case) to tweak up the settings to get noticed on its bass.- Very mediocre performance of mids and highs too. (Gets slightly better if tweaked with an eq app).- causes pain in ears if used continuosly.//If you are looking out for a decent budget USB c earphones mainly for calling, then go with this one. Works well for the voice calls//,It\\'s goodMic is not proper,I think this is the best c type headphone for this price segment. Sound quality, bass, meterial quality all are little above average so for RS.549 (blue) we can definitely buy without second thought.,Worked well for first two months. Now only one side is working.,I bought it to use with my Samsung S7 Plus which does not have any headphone jack. The bluetooth earphones work but when I\\'m in bed on my side, they have \"accidental touch\" with the pillow or somewhere. So, I bought these USB-C wired headphones. They work with my tab, which is good news. But the audio quality is average. It sounds tinny just like a 100rs headphones. Maybe that is to be expected because these earphones are cheap. So, I ended up not using them very often. I have been using this mouse for like 2 months and this is the best mouse under 500.the mouse has the basic gaming stuff like extra buttons dpi settings, but the main thing is the software like you can customize so much on this mouse the RGB is fully customizable, you can set many macros you can revamp the keys and also change the dpi values. these features usually come in expensive gamming mouses, but this is very good for this cheap.the design is also very good and one thing you should note before buying is that this mouse is big like it is big as my hand so if you got small hands, you should think twice, but it doesn\\'t affect that much i got the hang of it in like a week.it doesn\\'t come with any warranty so thats a con. but a part of it, everything is so good.Really would recommend,this mouse is very good for gaming, the high dpi sensor on this mouse is very good. their is no drifting. the rgb is very goodi have used this mouse for about 3 months and its still intact, no problem with scroll wheel or side button,the software provided by redgear is also very great and has lots of features.i mostly used this mouse for fps games like (csgo, valorant, overwatch)but the side buttons also help in building in fortniteonly issue is the build quality, some party feel kinda lose,its my first gaming mouse but damn its so good. the grip is perfect and dpi is also good at this range you shoud go for it if you get it under rupees 500.,No words. Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, don\\'t cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work (exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive). But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool (but you cant use just one single color). It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb. The cables braided too so there\\'s that!Verdict: Great value is you can get it for around Rs. 400 considering its looks and other subtle features.,,A fine mouse for what it\\'s worth. It just good for beginners you can start your work using this one, noise cancellation issue you can face while using this and some time connectivity problem also can face coz of it\\'s 3.5 mm jack it\\'s not working well sometime ....overall it\\'s okay at this price.,,Good quality sound.. better than phone microphone. It has a deep tone to it rather than compressed sounding audio from smartphone mic. Works with my nikon z50.,Great product for beginners,Like the product, works good at this price,Nice one,Sound good but capture ambiance Sound not deduct ambiance sound,I am very impressed this product.Best Mic. Great watch, good features. Easy and simple to use. Watch face is nice. Battery life is decent. Last for 4 days. Sensors work well. Smooth controls and display is bright. Only issue is that, after the watch came into contact with water it started malfunctioning. Power button not working, Bluetooth calling doesn\\'t work and battery gets quickly drained despite having Bluetooth off.,I have recently bought this product and i was not so happy and not worried. As advertised, this smart watch meets its purpose. Descent size and medium weight to wear always.Few of my suggestion to become a better watch:touch response can be improved, touch accuracy is less.resolution can be still more betterNeed to click on the button to see time or to awake. Instead of pressing button, should have give touch to awake.can have provide some more option like finding phone and finding smart watch ...,Product is good worth the money..there is a bit snag in wakeup mode while moving hands..it takes time to on the screen automatically .Overall good performance,Battery backup not good worst watch only 1 day it will come if you charge 100%....,Bought it 3 months back working fine call quality is good don’t expect great touch sensitivity,Found good and product finishing and features are super,The product is good with good battery life,Nice product but the touchscreen and app could have been better Nive,very good batteries received,Like,Good product, Good seller,Durable life,Great productAnd good packageNo damage,Good,Value for money. Delivered timely. Go for it. Good quality product, Best suitable size for Good quality video cameras like action camera but didn\\'t like sellers packaging he did no effort for packing simply picked from storage and dropped in Amazon bag then send for deliveryit might damage the product in transportation very irresponsible seller i had to instantly look it in device for damagebut it was working fine and memory card was very good quality,If you are looking to expand the memory for your nintendi switch oled, this is the best and cheap options available. The installation is quite easy.Highly recommended,Write speed is 60-70 at normal with a minimal level of 65 and peaks at 156..in mobileUPDATETHE DISAPPOINTING THING IS REED SPEED... I got upto 90 Mbps read and it won\\'t goes beyond 90mbps but write speed sometimes peaks at 120 Mbps... I GOT THIS MEMORY CARD ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF READ SPEED NOT FOR WRITING SPEED..because I won\\'t use this in any action camera or DSLR... ONLY FOR MOBILE WHICH NEEDS ATLEAST 150 Mbps for SMOOTH performance.....I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED FOR MY PURPOSE BUT satisfied.. according to price..So my conclusion if you are looking for a memory card for 4k/8k recording you can surely go for it..I case of u are purchasing on seeing it\\'s read speed and also for mobile it wouldn\\'t be a better option...,Expensive product,Good,Nice memory card,The delivered one was 90Mbps write property, i was expecting 190mbps write property,119gb Storage out of 128gb. Why ?ANSWERIT DEPENDS UPON OPERATING SYSTEM .Some phones take 1000MB=1gbSome phone take 1024MB=1gbExample Mi Phone will Show 128gb BUTSamsung will show 119gb only.Sum up 128 gb is given by manufacturerBut it depends upon format of phone reading the capacity  interms of 1000mb or 1024mbWhile It is very good. Product Quality is decent but the only problem I m facing is that is incompatible with with my Tablet and My Mobile Phone.If it was Compatible it would be great and Sometimes it Just keep Disconnecting from the device. I don\\'t know if it\\'s my device or its the product anyways it\\'s a good product to have all times.,Connecting pin was a bit tight to insert to my Macbook. Getting it for 399 from this brand is what made me order this. Go for it if you work only with usb devices. You can access 4 devices at a time but not sure about the speed while switchinf the windows. For now its quite okay to browse the files when one pen drive is connected.,USB port is somewhat not easy to plug. When connected to laptop its hard to remove it smoothly.,Served the purpose and delivered as marketed,I bought it for ₹451Overall 8/1010/10 Build- Sturdy and premium no doubt7/10 Functionality- 1 USB 3.0 Port (side one) & 3 USB 2.0(front 3)- My SSD gave 330ish MB/s Read/Write(seq) on the 3.0 Port (less for random read-write)- Same SSD gave 50ish(max) MB/s Read/Write(seq) on the 2.0 PortEven tho for me it is ok, they could\\'ve provided us with more high-speed ports(3.0),Cord is too short and price too high!,Bought this to use for connecting Mouse and Keyboard to my MacBook and have been using this for the last 6 months. Before buying this, i looked at multiple products at various price ranges. Finally, chose this product as this offers the brand assurance and is way cheaper compared to similar items from other reliable brands. So far, working really well 🙂,nice way to use usb-a devices on macbook air m2 in a cheap price The speaker\\'s sound is good and all the other feature are also at the best. the only problem is the battery backup it\\'s normally about 5hr, but that can be acceptable with this price.,Small but over all good,Price is too high for this product but sound quality is good,It\\'s like a pocket dynamite.,,LOUD AND GOOD BLUETOOTH SPEAKER,1. Tiny like big lemon2. Bluetooth is flaky3. Works for calls but again bluetooth slightly cuts off4. Audio out is okI suggest go for next model up in category. But this is good for its price,One of the best speaker I ever bought. It looks small in size but the sound that comes from it is clear and good. The cover comes up with good foam on both of sides enough to protect the laptop. It\\'s good for as it says 13\" inch laptops. I don\\'t know about the water resistance but except that it is good.,Average quality,Product quality is good, value for money but packaging was not good, they folded while packing. you can see mark on product added image.,a bit bigger for mac m1 but overall the product is goodprice should be around 500 max,Good Product,Built quality of product is excellent,Love the quality and overall look of the Laptop sleeve! It has got a sleek & minimalistic look.,Has a god soft side from inside and protects the Mac well I\\'m really liked the product more than expected. It\\'s really easy to use.,I like is that at this price range so you can go for it in this it\\'s a 3 and 1 combo where you can connect to phone or in pc , laptop at these price range,compatibility.Value for money,This is a gadget that I recommend all should have handy with them.Can used in multiple devices with multiple connectors. It is really easy and fast.,I got this product delivered on 20th Dec and it is working fine as expected. I thought it is a best buy to read Micro SD card and SDXC card also,All type if USB adapter present so u transfer data from any type of device,It works till now. Don\\'t know how long will it last.,Very easy handle Non returnable, so now using this as it is. Bandwidth control is a must for this price range. Model was archer c80.,Great delivery from amaozn.  It was easy to setup as a extender . Signal is also good but not that great. It can cover 1 flat well . Signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs. Overall great purchase. Must buy,Need little better customer support,good,I expected much stronger signal 10 meter away. Its okay working, but not as expected.,tp link is good product,Good product,Decided on buying this Router from TP-Link after days of research, reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different models.Was on a 20 Mbps connection with a Netgear N300 router since 2016 which used to suffice for moderate usage till now. However, with increase in the number of devices like Smart TV, 2 iPads and a laptop etc, it necessitated an upgrade. Also, considering the current work-from-home scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well, the internet usage was being stretched to it\\'s limit and the trusted Netgear router simply couldn\\'t match up to the increased bandwidth demand.To capitalise on the current situation, our current ISP came out with interesting Fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection. That in turn needed a new router to utilize it\\'s optimum potential. Finally zeroed in on the TP-Link Archer C80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers. Was also tempted to buy the AX1500 considering there\\'s barely any price difference, but then came across a few reviews which stated that Wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devices.Order delivered by Amazon within a day. Full marks for the seamless delivery as always. Prime has truly been a boon.Installed the Router today. Installation via Tether App was seamless. ISP guy helped with the PPPOE sign-in process and released the MAC ID which was bound to our old Router. The whole process was done in 10 mins and we were online.The dual bands are truly a boon. Have divided the devices at home equally between 2.4G and 5G as per usage. As the router is close to the TV unit, have connected it to 5G and also alternatively connected via the Ethernet cable (just in case).Speed tests:Started off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5G. Played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connected.Have attached a few pictures for reference.- Sitting near the Router, 5G Download speed is 77 mbps and Upload is 75.4 mbps.- 5G speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between: Download 72.4 mbps and Upload 74.9 mbps.- 2.4G speed in the same room as the Router is: Download 68.3 mbps and Upload 79.2 mbps. (This is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 50-55 mbps will be the threshold for 2.4G. Used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old N300).- Speed Test via the Ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the TV: Download 78 mbps and Upload 75 mbps.Couldn\\'t have asked for more really. This seems to be totally ideal.Build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job, however would have preferred that they were placed like other TP-Link models like the Archer A6, so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions.The LED lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough. Maybe I\\'m used to the prominent lights on my old Router. These are a blink-and-miss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case there\\'s an issue. One big element missing in this device is a USB port which is absolutely essential in today\\'s age and expected to be included for this price range. Wonder what\\'s the reason behind giving it a miss.I have sealed the extra LAN ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture. It\\'s a good practice. The outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish, however I\\'m a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion.Functionally though, this seems to be a real good offering from TP-Link. Hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days. All-in-all, seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years, considering an internet plan upgrade, if any.Hope I touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice. This product is RECOMMENDED! :) I first used non-parker ink for my fountain pen and hesitantly switched to Parker Quink Ink, given the cost was many times higher than regular ink. But it is worth every paise. The Quink ink is clearly worth it with its thick blue color and giving superb contrast on white paper.,Best product,Good,No,DislikeI have a ink pot of pilot andI was thinking to buy the parker one,Rate is too high but quantity is too low,The quantity is little.,Best quality I have been using it for the past week; no complaints so far. It\\'s really good and gives the laptop proper ventilation to breathe air.,Nice,At first I was reluctant if the stand will be good. However now after using it I can tell for sure it is a nice product and really helps to correct our posture,Good companion for my laptop. can carry easily in laptop bag anywhere,If you are working in IT with neck pain with your Laptop, then this is your product,Nice product. Good built quality.,Comparing to metal stand, the stability is good no shaking.. it\\'s holding my 4kg heavy laptop.. mobile stand is not good, no stability at all.. for laptop it\\'s best..,Good product I had been using a Logitech MK270 for a couple of years before a couple of keys started getting iffy (no spills or accidents). With an overall positive impression of Logitech\\'s performance (compared to my experience with similar from Dell, HP) - I decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact MK215.While I knew this would be more compact, with fewer keys - I feel I should highlight the disadvantages I can see immediately (especially for users of full-size keyboards at work - refer image)1. While my hands will get used to closer keys - they also seem much less \"springy\" (lower). Overall size is also too small to place on one\\'s lap and type, which I could with the other wireless keyboard, especially during WFH.2. Big point is the MUCH larger size of the dongle. This will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time I throw my laptop into my bag for a meeting. I never did this for MK270 and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop USB port. That dongle also had a slot inside the mouse for safekeeping, which is not there in MK215.3. Neither mouse nor keyboard has a switch off - MK270 had switch on both. MK215 mouse takes 2 AA, whereas MK270 takes 1 battery.4. Mouse is shaped different - lower arch and wider - which may simply take adjusting. Feels a little cheaper.While a real review can only be provided much later - seeing how keys/clicks perform over the long run (and one hopes that Logitech will have taken care of that quality) - while I don\\'t have any complaints so far, I feel paying a bit extra for the MK270 may suit many folks out there. Hope the review helps - will update later if I see find any fundamental issues with time.,Product is good but lagging very much.Not enjoying/ satisfied with this product.Bad  for me😞😔.,It is working fine till now.,The keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards. It works well and keys and ok.,Excellent,Go fot it good product, handy.. just connector is little bit big size,Works properly.Initially noticed lag and then looked it up online.It seems USB receiver faces interference when another port next to it is plugged in to other device.I had the lag of both mouse and keyboard actions but noticed that my USB receiver was plugged next to HDMI port which was also connected to a monitor. I switched the USB receiver to another USB port on other side of laptop without any neighboring ports. Don\\'t face lag now.Try to use a USB hub if you don\\'t have a USB port away from existing used ports.,Build quality and all are good but the batteries cap is little bit loose for the keyboard and mouse is totally fine. ____________________Technical Specifications---------------------------------Here\\'s the technical information of Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones. The information provided below is as per the manufacturer.\\uf0a7 Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz.\\uf0a7 It Features 10 mm drivers.\\uf0a7 Rated Impedance of 16 ohms.\\uf0a7 Comes with 1.2 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable.\\uf0a7 3.5 mm Gold-Plated L-Shaped Audio Jack (90 degrees).\\uf0a7 Sensitivity : 98 dB+/-3 dB.____________________Built Quality & Design---------------------------------I was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal. It has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel & attractive appearance. The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable & does it\\'s job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. Despite the metal construction, Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight & comes with a microphone & L-Shaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. Overall the built quality is excellent for the price & seems very durable. The ear buds have proper L & R labels and are clearly visible. Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.___________Audio Quality-------------------To ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit, I used high-quality MP3 files of 320 kbps & Lossless audio formats like FLAC & WAV. For smartphone listening, I used Poweramp music player & tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. For the computer, I used iTunes player & VLC Audio player. I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod, iPhone & Sony MP3 Player. All this went for more than 10 days & finally, I had my results.Boat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. During my tests with them, I found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. The treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear & pleasant to ears. The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent. When listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.______________________Noise Isolation & Comfort-------------------------------------When it comes to Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it, They come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, I wasn\\'t able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely & delivered an immersive experience. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff & somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. Since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now & then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didn\\'t happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now & then while running (maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it), An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it. When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as I got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.-----------------------------------------Flat Cable & Microphone-----------------------------------------The cable is great, I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free & comes with a rubberized coating. The cable does its job well. The microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. During calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up/reject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. It can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225.____________________Warranty & Price---------------------------------Boat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty._____________Final Thoughts!----------------------I\\'ve personally used Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and I\\'m pretty much impressed with them. I\\'m personally a fan of Extra Bass IEM\\'s and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDR-XB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDR-XB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didn\\'t disappoint me, obviously it doesn\\'t stand a chance in front of Sony MDR-XB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225 & the quality they offer, I was really very impressed.Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, I can say that they\\'re amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, I\\'ll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like Poweramp (Android) for better bass output. The treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average.*****************************My Rating : 4 out of 5*****************************____________________The Verdict---------------------------------Taking everything into account, overall I\\'m very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage. Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids & highs. Overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. I\\'ll recommend these IEM\\'s to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop sound really great on them. Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.HOPE I HELPED YOU.THANKS,Yes, so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500. Yes you can consider it to buy. But there are few points to remember before buy. From my user experience I can tell you this-1. This is not comfortable at all. It slips from ear mostly. You feel pain in ear after using it.2. Never buy this for ONLINE CLASS, as it is not possible to wear it 6-8 hours straightly.3. After switching from Boat Basshead 172, I feel that the bass is not good as the previous one. I don\\'t know why. It should be better.4. Sound don\\'t explode or go outside of the buds to 50% as it go outside on Boat 510 headphone, so its good.5. Feeling heavier on ears. Not as comfortable as Realme Buds 2. Though both are metal build. For balance sound you can buy Realme Buds 2.6. Buy it only to listen music, not for too long time. Do not consider it for Online class and Long time wear session.  Hope it helped you. Its just my opinion from using Boat 225, Boat 172, Boat 510, Realme buds 2, Mi basic.,It\\'s a very good product but i don\\'t recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head, they will fall off easily with the slightest motion, you will soon find it annoying. Sound quality, build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you.,Raat me apne Babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta h,I purchased the product a year ago.It worked fine.I love the sound quality.but you may not expect it to work after a year.My headphone doesn\\'t work  now properly .My warranty get expired so ,I have to buy a new one.,Good buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 6-7 month,Sound quality is above average .. but I got 1.5 years old manufactured ear phones.. build quality is as per cost . can\\'t expect much .. there is buzzzzz sound when music is silent..,The earphones sound is awesome Nice notebook with sufficiently good quality papers..The add in the bind cover is removeble and can be make it more aesthetic.The only thing is price is little bit inappropriate considering the number of pages.but overall it is a good notebook for study purpose.go for it👍,Product quality is really good. The cover gives a premium look to this product. Page quality could have been better.,I like this product.,Decent quality, page not too thick, i would have preferred a higher gsm, but still decent. Sturdy,This is one of the best book or dairy  I have seen before but too much expensive.,Really good quality paper along with the multi colored subject dividers and the outer covering. I got it for 165rs and this product has an MRP of 315 rupees. Offline I would end up paying at least 300rs for this. So overall a really good buy.,Page quality: excellentInk overlap: close to none unless you\\'reputting much pressure. Even fountain pens are good.Cover: wow!Con: it\\'s not really a con but u gotta turn the pages really carefully otherwise they might get torn. The pages are 70 gsm but turning carelessly will definitely damage the pages which is kinda difficult when you\\'re in hurry during revision. This is the only con of these spiral notebooks.,I ordered 5 notebooks, out of which one had poor binding and I had to repair it manually. Otherwise, the page quality is good. Does not have enough oomph and quickly loses power. Makes you wonder whether it really is Duracell. Such is the life of the batteries. Indeed firs the name- Chitra power,Got it just now. Hope it last longer than Eveready\\'s cells. Excellent packaging as well.,There are two more... looks fine waiting for durable report,Good,Value for money. Long lasting.,Longevity and power is the best,Badhiya,Like Always wanted to purchase it but never got a chance before I built a pc for my sister. Zebronics has always delivered us with the best state of the art hardwares for gaming. Out of which this combo is one of the shining star.,The alphabet don\\'t light up just the keyboard does.You can\\'t see anything in dark even if the keyboard lights are on.,Does not have light in letter so it is hard to type and play,I hate about mouse and keybordit dont has a software and no single color,Less rbg modes  gaming is good and ergonomic is good and brightness is good but less,I like this product it is verry good for gammers speassily I think you can go for itIt delivered one day before for me the gamming expreance is more better with zebronic it is a verrrrrrrrry goooood product it more actractive while gamming at dark 👍👍👍👍👍,Keyboard  and mouse both are good but can go for an better  option  also,Buy in sale for just 999Have good look but not feels so premiumMouse build is more bad than keyboard.Number key led panel almost out of the frame. The pendrive is good enough. But don\\'t have a higher expectation from this pendrive. It gets heated after when transferring a file and the speed also reduces drastically.If you are looking for a high speed pendrive then this is not for youFor normal uses it is good enough ,can connect to phone as well.I got it for Rs.489 only.,Good product no problem,Very useful and best for use two in one purpose for transfer data from lap or mobile,Good purchase..just that I find the type c side doesn\\'t fit well in some devices, keeps shaking and disconnecting..so have to be careful while transferring from such devices,Easy to use and fast to upload. Cost is slightly high.,Nice,Transfer Speed for files is good.,232 GB onlyavailable total 256 GB and durable is little bad Easy to hold and to good in this price,The quality is really good!The pen for me it was a bit slipperyBut the comfort was all rightI recommend you to buy this product as it has value for money and it works smoothly and better than my imagination,Beautiful and classy design with great grip.

Don\\'t buy if you are buying it for than this price. If you just wanna try out a smart watch, this is really nice. But if you are expecting too many features in it , then go for a pricier one. At least for this watch, u don\\'t have too many features, and you have to use your phone to set up most of the things ( like alerts and notifications, Do not disturb mode and even alarms too!!)Other than that, its touch response is pretty decent, has got nice watch faces (you can make your own as well) and battery is long lasting (at least for my usage, lasts more than 10 days).Also notice that the wrist isn\\'t black, its dark grey. But the dial is black,This item is best quality. The price is very worthable. This product\\'s overall quality is quite good. I will recommend to purchase this item.,the design of this watch is really good ... i got this at 1499 in Amazon sale and it\\'s really value for money 👍,Super,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/615xQV8mNDL._SY88.jpg,Amazing look,Screen refresh rate is bit low ,but a great product for this price !,Best product ,Package arrived in a big box, inside the table was packaged inside another box, the drawer was stuck or locked a little bit, but then came out. Quite good product, just a little costly,I use this on my bed only . These type of support to the table bottom make it very stable even on a bed . Really thought full design . Material is good .Smooth finish & the plastic helps keep your forearms on it so comfy.You could get it for 200 bucks cheaper from their official website though. The place for keeping your phone is good . The cup holder is a bit too small and only holds small cups of 200 ml . Water bottles / shakers can\\'t be put there . It is a really solid table with great clearence 28 mm . I thought 25mm too would be ok but i would highly suggest 28 mm ones . Its width & length is perfect and should be the standard at 40 cm & 60 cm . Great product ! 10/10 . Now i use this as my main work station all day.,The table is fantastic but I got a dameged Or broken one. One corner is broken. Overall table is good. I returned it and got a new one. This is strong but plastic at the joint of legs and ply can be better.. Overall this is a good table.,The product quality is good. The size of the product little small. It is stable not bending while working on that. Little expansive also... Over all the product review is good one.,Like 👍,It wobbles a little coz of the bed mattress. Otherwise, it is very study and quite light weight as well. Perfect for everyday use.,It will last a long time.Quality is awesome, it\\'s stable even when kept on bed for writing.The drawer feature is also quite useful. The product seems and works good but it\\'s not a fast  charging cable as it has to be and when all the three ports are connected its more slower I\\'m charging  only good is single cable all three ports are there so its a ok product only if yiu are looking for fast charging then I would say think twice before you buyI have been using foe a while now this is for sure not a fast charging cable and in this tge lightning charger is not working properly every now and then I have to check its it charging my iPhone and I had to unplug and reply for charging its getting disconnected I don\\'t understand how  so this cable is no ok,i used this type c most commonly depending on my devices power wats and also etc,,Nice charger,Charging is bit slow when u connect multiple devices.Cannot transfer data.Only Charging purpose.,So nice colour cheap and best,The cable looks decent with charging. But not fit for me as it does not support Apple car play, Using since last  two weeks  .,Good,Good, nice, worth it, perfect,Does its job, the build quality of the wire is good nothing to complain about.,Good quality product works well.,Reasonable price, good quality.,wao wao super speed fast asf, Typing is easy, comfortable and fast but keyboard is not good for gaming. The buttons when pressed and held down for long time can remain stuck when released. The button itself doesn\\'t stay down but it still keeps working until I press it again. Died in games many times by falling from high places.I had this same issue in my old hp pavilion laptop keyboard too actually. Something they should have a look into.,I am using 6 month.This is now performing good and smooth.very good product.,Good product,Lack of led for power level,  caps and numlock is a big headache.,keyboard doesn\\'t have that much tactile feel like my wired HP keyboard. definitely looks good & works perfectly. mouse is a bit small compared to wired ones. not sure about battery. just started using it.,I buyed it,I am working with it, and it\\'s good.,Nice product One amazing cable for 300 bucks,Ok with charging. Looks very sturdy and durable.,Fast charging upto 25watts 2m in length and really durable.Bought it like the 4th time passed down my older cables to family members all still in working state.,I bought it in 2019 and it almost last three years post heavy usage... Gonna buy it again! Very good quality,Good quality USB C Charging cable that enables Fast Charging for Samsung M21 as well as M33 5G 24 W seeking phones. 2 metre cable length helpful in keeping phone on desk while Charging Adaptor plugged into Electric Outlet. Best value. Similar 2 m cable costs 3x or 4x in retail market. This is best price,Great product. Wanted this as my Portable battery has USB slot and iPad and Kindle Reader have USB-C ports. Fits my requirement perfectly. Charges very fast.,good,Very good overall This mic\\'s sound quality is very good but if you are looking for a mic which you will use in your PC then don\\'t buy this microphone because it doesn\\'t come with a TRRS to TRS converter. Overall good mic and wire length is also average 1 Meter. In this price range its very worth it to buy this mic but if you want to use in Laptop or PC then buy Maono AU 400 microphone which comes with a converter and it is also very good mic.,Not suitable for DSLR camera,Just good for yt,Okay 👌,Product is not good for anyone. It is scrap and waste of money.,,Not too good,It has a good sound and audio quality. It have  not very good in noise cancellation. It will filter some minute sound .It is helpful for YouTube video creators.But the clip is very hard so I can\\'t fit it in shirt.It is worth for the cost. Audio quality is good for this price range. The noise cancellation also works pretty well. Best thing is that it fits well in my ears. The functionality of microphone is also good because it reduces the unwanted environmental noise for eg when you are talking to someone in a crowded place.,One tap (left/right) --- Pause/PlayDouble tap (left/right) --- previous/nextThree tap (left/right) --- volume -/+Four tap left --- Music/ GameFour tap right --- Base/ Rock/ HiFiRight hold --- change ANC / No ANC / TransparentLeft hold --- Bixby/ Siri /Google assistantHold for longer time --- Turn offThese are the touch controls for omega .ANC is not that much good. But okay. Gives good backup.For a price range of 2000 it is good. ENC is okay.No app or anything to equalize , have to do it with built in mobile equalizer.,Noice cancellation is not good. It\\'s lower quality system. Otherwise Sound Quality is GOOD. Bass is Ok. Looking Very Nice, Good fittings. Touch Sensor almost good work.,It\\'s a good set overall. Sometimes it doesn\\'t auto-connect and I need to open Bluetooth settings in my phone/laptops to manually connect - which is little annoying for me.,Other then latency.. it is not good for gaming.. environment sound is not good.. you cannot tell the direction of foot steps until it\\'s too close.. don\\'t buy it for gaming... Other than gaming it\\'s a good earphone in this price range..,Good product. Decent sound. Bass should have been better. Treble is slightly on the higher note. ANC works well and subdue ambient noise.,I liked it,Good Perfect for a 10 inch tablet both vertically and horizontally,It was the best phone holder,Good,Premium quality and reasonable price 👍🏼,Fulfil purpose, easy to carry, solid material. Think it will last long.,Nice,Liked the product. Easy to carry, portable,  foldable, lightweight.,Good I really like this wireless mouse it has became my daily driver. The connection is instant and fast. The mouse is super comfortable in my hand. The click is easy and perfect feel. Very responsive and the look is stylish and compact.,I bought this wireless mouse because of its compact form factor. It can be carried easily in laptop bag avoiding and hump forming in bag. Product built is sturdy. Scroll wheel is smooth.,The mouse is as per my expectations and really it\\'s working smoothly and not making a tik sound like any other mouse. OTG given with the mouse is not working.,I found this product extremely user friendly and satisfactory. The mouse is perfectly designed and provides an excellent grip. The sensitivity is calibrated to the finest. Comes with silent click feature.,This mouse is really working very well the quality and the speed of the pointer mouse is very accurate and coming to distance it even works from very long distance.,It is flawless and very nice to use and hold. Initially, I think it will take sometime to get used to the size and shape of the Mouse, but after that, its very smooth. Also, it is very silent,Best mouse in this price range Built quality is so good. Response time is so amazing. Overall very happy  with the product.,Excellent mouse for this price. Felt its far better than HP Logitech Zebronics and Dell wireless mouse as i have used all of the above I installed it in my ASUS TUF FX505DT and i use it for gaming earlier it have 8gb RAM after installing it total RAM is 16gb and fps in game increased i am satisfied from this product 🥰,I received a defective piece. I already check my laptop before purchasing that which ram would be compatible and is my laptop really supports upgrading. After thorough research, I purchased this RAM.When I tried installing it, my laptop showed a blank screen. I tried switching ports on both the rams (pre-installed and crucial). But my laptop was working with the pre installed and was not with crucial one. I tried all possible combinations and it was apparent that the ram I received was defective.I head straight to replace the product but there was no option for that. No return option as well. I only had one option to contact the customer care so, I contacted them and explained the issue in detail. They asked me to hold and connected me to an so called expert. The expert did not ask me anything just asked me to upload a picture that I already did. Then so called expert asked me to upload the picture on the link that she would be sharing, which I never received. I even tried rating but thanks to the amazon iOS app even that was not possible coz there was no scroll bar on the rating tab. I do not know whether I would receive any support or not but this was a pathetic experience and I had never expected this from amazon. It would be an end for this 8+ years old bond with amazon if I would not receive any support on this.I will update this if I receive some help!Issue fixed after struggling 4 days. But RAM is great!,Its better to install it with SSD. I felt very good performance uplift in my laptop after installing both SSD & this 8 GB ram.,My laptop had 8GB ram before I ordered crucial DDR4 8gb Sodimm RAM and it\\'s really increase multi-task, my coding experience also increase, Android Studio Take less time than before, Still I didn\\'t play any game yet..But I will update you when I play any game in future,First of all let me clear any confusion for other buyer , it\\'s r*8 ram which i received clearly mentioned on the ram sticker 8gb operating at 3200mhz ,If your existing ram in your laptop is operating less then 3200mhz it will automatically reduce its MHz to default (the ram which alredy installed in your laptop) .,Initially I doubted coz i dnt have much idea about all these electronic but after watching YouTube videos I finally installed it and it worked.My Laptop Aspire A5 with 4gb installed ram, now it is 8+4=12 gb.Lets c if my laptok gives good performance.,Good ram on a good price .It\\'s a dual ranked 3200 mhz ram.Many say that you can\\'t use a 8 gb and 16 gb in dual channel mode but believe me u can.If u don\\'t know about ur system configuration then before buying just scan with crusial scanner.,Good RAM with decent price, easy to install and so far performance looks good. Have to test it during gaming. But so far so good. My office PC UPS Legrand  Numeric UPS Digital 600EX-V is having only one LED and beep codes. This is not sufficient, if we want more details. However the unit is robust, easy to disassemble, easy to replace battery with generic battery, having best transfer time (less than 4 milli Sec) 37min backup for CPU + Monitor when checked. In view of this,  the Legrand Numeric UPS Digital 600EX-V should my the number one choice. But it also has low  user ratings.The  following brands  came to my notice on search.1) APC BX600C-IN2) APC BX600CI-IN3) Emerson Liebert iTon CX 600(I have not considered microtek, intex, iball; vguard etc may be they are good)The technical parameters of the above all looked similar , like generator compatibility, AVR, High/low/overload protections. But the transfer time specified for Numeric is less than 4 milli sec, for  APC 10 milli sec typical, and for Liebert 4-8 milliseconds.APC BX600C-IN  is selected as my requirement is not for PC or laptop (further search is not done for UPS with communication port and auto save software ) and  in view of better interface  ( Power LED Dual color, Charging LED Dual colour, Battery saver LED ) . It also has  better backup and surge power than APC BX600CI-IN (minus resettable thermal relay)Based on the reviews, there are four major issues i have noticed,(1) very old stock (Battery capacity expected to be in reduced condition, resulting into low backup time) or battery issue.(2) Transit damages, as it is bulky to its volume. Though it is better to purchase such items offline, I still tried online in view of remote location.(3) No load protection .  It acts  if very low load is connected (e.g. just modem  or less than 30w and battery saver mode is on  ) after 5 min , people get confused it as giving only 5 min backup (it shouldn\\'t be considered as a problem once known, since additional loads can be connected or battery saver mode can be unselected)(4) If Battery saver is enabled , it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left (it shouldn\\'t be considered as  a problem,  since it can be unselected if selected intentionally or unintentionally)To reduce the above risks, M/s Appario Retail Private Ltd was chosen (at lightening deal at Rs Rs2659.00). The order was placed on 10.04.19. The product is delivered in 4 days on 13.04.19. The original packing was wrapped in repeated turns of polyethylene. The packing reached without any major distortions. The original cartoon packing was in sealed condition. However when it was opened, some (parts) looseness sound was coming from the UPS. The same was reported to APC service center. They registered the complaint and told me that the service person will visit within 48 hours of working days. Further they have given clearance to put the UPS in service.First it was charged fully , while UPS in off condition (charging light was on while charging and it became off after charging). Now the UPS was made on by power button (it is to be pressed and hold for not less than 1 second before release or release after beep tone) connected to PC with 32 inch LED TV, initially some repeated chattering (without any power interruption to the load) was happening, if power input is kept off (on battery). It was happening some times.When it is on battery,  beep sound was occurring every 22 sec against APC Manual spec of 60 sec.it withstood for 18 minutes for the PC with 32 inch LED TV on battery. (Battery save mode was in off condition)Further it got switched off within 5 sec of low battery alarm, against 60 sec specified in the manual.The manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was Nov, 2018 (photo attached) but the test and quality passing date is 11.01.2018 12.53 hrs (photo attached)(As my load is more than 30w,  I can put it on battery saver mode, the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan 2 seconds before release to change the state , this  is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manual).The UPS body temperature appears to be on higher side, when compared to Numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature (while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mains).The above is initial experience only, any updates shall be shared in future.Note1: This item isn\\'t eligible for returnFor safety reasons, items containing flammable liquids or gases can\\'t be returned to Amazon. For more information or help, please contact them.(If you want return facility search for other alternatives)Update 1The service person called me on 14.04.19 and informed about his planned visit on 15.04.19.The service person visited in the morning of 15.04.2019 and disassembled the UPS, there was a  minor play with the battery, ( the whole casing is of plastic, one side cover opens including top as one part) the play may be due to design / manufacturing tolerances. The PCB and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight. Hence the looseness is acceptable. The battery manufacturing date was Oct 2018. I agreed for his optional proposal to replace with a new sealed battery (but manufactured in Sept 2018). The chattering may be relevant to building wiring, as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove UPS input plug from the same socket (see next update for accurate reason) .  In the whole,  the service person’s only concern was hotter transformer, based on his experience (but it will be replaced only if it fails).Prompt response of service center is appreciable (that too for an interior of 76 km from service center, located at state capital) and it compliments the non return policy.Update 2It is fully charged with replaced battery  and backup time was tested with the same load as above. But this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and  parameters (difficult to reason out) as below.Backup time is 32 Min (until some different  type of blinking of power led  & different type of beeps happens for few seconds, may be relevant to battery saver mode  and however it got normalized in auto ) after 5 min further,  the battery low blinking of power LED occurred (hence total 37 min against 18 min of earlier experience as above) and these beeps occurred for 40 seconds before it tripped (against 5 seconds of earlier experience as above), but power LED was glowing for every few seconds till further 20 seconds in off condition.Battery on  beep was occurring for every 59.90 seconds (~1 min) to indicate the load is on battery (against every 22 second earlier experience as above). I was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly, bulky and  distant service partner type equipment at my home . He has replaced only battery, and he has not even removed the PCB. But how,  so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned out.Note 2:I) NonRMS-Multimeter does not properly read the voltage of a UPS that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery. Hence  output voltage of a 230 VAC UPS is measured to be between 170-180 VAC when on battery.Ii) Low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage , high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of UPS (while on battery)Iii) chattering may take place at UPS if any separate surge protection is used at UPS outletIv) some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to UPSV) APC service person informed that APC UPS will not on, if house is not properly grounded (earthing is to be proper) to protect from surges.Vi) if UPS is on battery with battery saver mode enabled  (i.e. mains off) it will give only 5 min backup to loads less than  30w (as no load protection acts),  however if the load is more than 30w , it shutdowns while 5 min juice still left ( i.e. if we disable battery saver mode  we will get 5 min more backup power)From the above , the UPS is now functioning as per specifications. (but one star of APC is reduced against initial issues of equipment, though super fast response exists from their service center) , 5 stars to  \"M/s Appario Retail Private Ltd\" the seller, 5 stars to the APC service center and 5 stars to courier \" M/s Delivery\" for safe and fast delivery.Update 3: After 4 months of use , backup time testing (ignoring erroneous tests in between):The ups was made on and battery saver was made off , due to this  the ups started self charging further and I have waited till the charging is completed. Now,  the TV as monitor with PC were made on ( it took upto 0.45 amp during cold boot , amp measured with clamp meter) while mains is on. once the PC stabilised (0.3A) the mains is switched off. Now it gavea  backup of 17 minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at 17th min. Again every min one beep started for 5 min. After this repeated beeps occurred  for 30 second and ups got tripped. Hence I got 22 minutes and 30 seconds in total. In view of this the star rating is retained at 4 star.One more observation is that it\\'s transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means (more) energy is being wasted by transformer.I got the battery replaced one more time on 15,01.2020 under warranty as backup time reduced to 11min under the same conditions and load. With new battery I am getting 24 minutes. Hence the Apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where Apc quality person should have control. After warranty I will install battery from exide and see.,Pros:The device is sleek, small and blends into the environment.Cons:Makes a lot of noise.I bought this primarily to support my television Sony XR-65X90K to handle the switch from generators to mains (For < 30 Secs). It is not sufficient to do that and the TV switches on and off continuously when running on UPS power. I\\'m not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficient.If you have a similar use case as mine, better consult a local inverter shop and get a UPS that fits your requirement. Else, you will end up with dead weight.,Easy to install,My PC has a 550W PSU with 80+ Bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond 280watts under max load. This UPS shuts down as soon as my GPU (GTX 970) reaches 100%.Then I used it for my printer. But as soon as I hit print, the UPS shuts down. So it\\'s useless there as well.Now it\\'s attached to my TV, router and speakers. Atleast I can watch Netflix uninterrupted.,I\\'m getting trouble in this I think this is not working properly where should I return,Value for money, so far working good.,Small but big life of battery,It is good for electricity stability Good product,Thought the book would be longer but it\\'s quite small.

It is also good for travelling where you have to keep it in the bags without any kind of box. I would recommend it to all.,Best wire type c to lighting connector go buy worth of money,Value for money,I am happy with product. Quality is good. Durable. [Updated]  Overall you really get what you pay for. They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.If you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn\\'t work. This is starting to get annoying but maybe I\\'ll get used to it. We\\'ll see.----------------------------------------------------------This is just day 1 review of these. Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon. I\\'ll post updates later on. Hope this is helpful for anyone interested.Package : The packaging is quite decent for such a low price. Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs - small and large. Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.Build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.Comfort : This is very subjective and each ear is different. It\\'s one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if I\\'m OK with the form factor for long hours. The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones. And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them. The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don\\'t cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. One thing to note is that if you have \"Gandhi\" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - I should know. My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions. YMMV.Sound quality : I liked them. I\\'m no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. I tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/J0a2Prc_MQo and they fared quite well. The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. I feel this definitely punches above its price point.Call quality : In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you\\'re inside a well. Seems the mics can\\'t figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. Overall you get what you pay for here.Range : max I got was around 5m. Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess that\\'s passable.Pairing :------ UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022  - - - - - -Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.Have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------I don\\'t have a phone to test the fast pair features - Actually I\\'m not even sure these support it. Anyway, the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.Battery life : Way too early to tell anything. Will share my experience post one week and one month. But they came around 80% charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case - Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. The earphones also have LEDs that blink red & white to indicate pairing, low battery etc.Sync issues : None so far. But have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the L and R earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price TWSes. So will see if I face any such problems.These are the primary areas that I am concerned with while evaluating any TWS so will share how my experience is after a while. So far I\\'m happy with them.,Hi, My name is Akshay.I used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable money.good in calling also.everything is perfect.,Good Sound Quality...,Buds are very good Quality. With great noise cancellation feature.,When we received this order box is already opened like this.I was not expected at all.,what i don\\'t like is the earpads, sometime it came out don\\'t know the reason even i tried different fits. Rest is great.,Amazing sound,It is the best choice for the product It\\'s smooth and good quality. The bottom has a finish which stops it from moving... Good product,Better to buy a better one for more price,I like this mouse pad. I have no problem with this item.,I wanted to order a mousepad that wasn\\'t a ginormous waste of money, like adding a gaming brand\\'s logo on a pad shouldn\\'t cost 500 bucks, but here we are.It\\'s a smooth mouse pad that grips the table perfectly. Looks and build quality are good. Stitching looks okay, not a single strand standing out. Though I\\'m talking from a perspective of a person who needs a mousepad, not a gamer who\\'s on their 3rd mousepad purchase in a year. ( I\\'m a gamer myself but don\\'t need a proper desktop setup yet).,Not meant for gaming obviously,look at its size man, it feels like you have a kid slave while gaming XD,Good product,Great mousepad, looks subtle, feels good, mice work great on it. Stitching seems like it’ll hold up. Worth it just for the price.,Good quality & comfort. But it isn\\'t washable. Will have to throw it eventually even if it doesn\\'t go bad. Good quality product at this price,Its good but could be smaller and easier to carry,It\\'s really hard from outside, which will protect your kept inside stuffs even if heavy things got loaded on it. Size is big. Surface area is great. Two ear leads with small stuff like pendrive Or ear buds can be there, even after closing/zipping. Really good one. LOVE !!! LOVE !!!,Durable and compact, overall a good product vs expensive cases.Can be used for either: 1. Earphone + charger cables or 2. Charger + charger cableCharger + Cable + Earphone is a bit stretch for this one.,Good,Excellent compact and strong case for storing wired headphones. Only thing missing is a handle or a loop attached to zipper for easy carrying.,This is the case you need to store your earphones. Provides excellent protection and is very useful to carry around your earphones!,Good Good Product But Spped Upto 30mbps,Nice,Superb card for DSLR camera 😊👍Instant support must buy 👍Totally satisfied with the product 👍👍👍😊,Highly recommended purchase,Good,Seems I am fooled by Amazon by selling to me a fake SanDisk 128GB memory card. The card died in 3 months. All the pictures, memories got swept away. It is mentioned that it comes with 10 year Warranty.  I have registered the card on sandisk official but did not receive any compensation (refund/replacement) till date even after raising the ticket. Amazon better not sell such cheap crap and loose trust.,Good,working fine read/write speed is good LED is good however the stand that is shipped with the product seems to be manufactured in some local Gaziabad street side factory. The quality and precision are so bad that even this can\\'t hold the LED properly.,This product helps in making video professionally and really value for money.,Nice product,,Pros:1. Product quality is good.2. Sturdy feel and good fitting.3. Medium size is better.4. Light intensity is okay but can be even better.5. Wire length is okay.6. Mobile holder is sturdy and fits well.7. Height for a 6.2 ft person is okay.Cons:1. RGB is not that good; very low light.2. Not that easy to dismantle, as sometimes it becomes wobbly while handling.,Not bad,Worth for money but built quality improved required in inner thread to plastic mould place,Lightweight yet sturdy enough. Can select different height according to your requirement. Ring light is not very bright even at it\\'s highest setting but if you even have moderate lighting in the room, pics/video will turn out good. Good for beginners. All good,Product is Good,i love the Notebook .Quality is Good . And I like the texture of page and Packaging is also Good Not Bad Value for money,Good quality copy pages are soft and bright.Feels good in writing,Note book is good and paking is very bad,very nice book,Good set of 12 books. Value for money and outer cover is very lovely and Good to use, I will surely recommend this to everyone to buy it, and my father took 2 books on seeing it.,The books are in great condition they also have a matte finish good quality paper I will surely purchase again I am not a pro-gamer, i play gta, valo and cs:go, this mouse is enough for casual gaming, and i didn\\'t find any issues with it, although after a year something, i can hear the parts in side the mouse rattling, but that could be because, the mouse was dropped several times though the year. maybe it\\'s well built so, even the counterparts are moving the mouse still works,Good at this price,Nothing much to say sbout it. It does the job and cable is strong enough. Decent buy if you want a simple mouse with long enough cable.,the product built is quite good and hold is also nice must buy if you are looking for a good mouse at this price,A standard mouse with good build quality. Can be used for both office and home basic purposes.,Cheap in priceGreat built qualitySmooth in useBest over other mouses of this price segment and even better than costly mouses.Prefect product overall.If you want good daily use mouse go for it over any mouse in the market,Can be used for normal purpose. Adequate length of the cable. Brand value comes with quality. Easy to use, not suitable for gaming.,been using from a while and its super comfortable I\\'ve just started using it, i can\\'t say much about its sturdiness. Lookwise it does feel sturdy but depending on the usages it will show how long ot will last,At all stages one side of the stand doesn\\'t fit properly.,Not that perfect, one side has a little gap,Quite satisified with the product after about 2 weeks of use. Value for the money. Ergonomics is satisfactory, but still it needs to be looked into. From the looks of it, it would have a long term durability also.,This is an awesome product that I have purchased till date for my WFH purpose. It can hold 14\" Laptop very well. It can be adjusted for different heights. Grip to the table is really good. It helps to view the laptop with required angle. Easy to carry. Looks really great on a black table. Classic silver piece. Packaging is also very good.,3.5 starsI got this delivered today and tried it out. My laptop is 2.5 KG and 17 inches, a bit of a heavy machine.While the stand held my laptop, it did not fit properly. Because of the laptop\\'s weight or the size, the front of the laptop raises instead of staying on the padded notches. Have to move the machine forward a bit for it to stay on.If you want to use it as simply a stand - where you set the laptop and use external devices to use it like the mouse, gamepad or the keyboard, it is fine. You can go for it.If you want to use the machine itself when on the stand - touchpad and keyboard, you might face some issues. Using it directly is making the machine a bit wobbly.Will test it out with heavy work / gaming to see how the temperature holds. Might edit the review and the rating after using it a bit.,The product itself is awesome and in modern day where ease to carry and compact products are preferred it is a good choice , my only reason to give 4 stars and removing one out of five is the product latches (linkages/arms that set the level of elevation angle ) are bit free And can be undone from one of either side with a slight jerk while the second side latch supports all the weight in the meantime.,It is very convenient and compact to carry along with you. Definitely value for money 👍 It\\'s been only 10 days and used it to transfer 64gb for now.. so i have not used it enough..i would update this after some days.. my relative bought seagate onetouch (Its best competitor) so i would compare it with it..**SPEED**Multiple Photos (32gb): Got 105 mbps max but 95 consistent..Single file(4.2gb):Got 117mbps max and it was more or less consistent..The onetouch reached 133mbps for multiple big files.. didnt check it further..**BUILD**It is very sleek and lightweight.. for sure.. but it does not feel very premium.. it is plastic all around.. you can definitely feel the vibration of the platters while file transfer..the onetouch was very premium feeling..metal and plastic body.. and i could feel its vibrations.. but it was much less than passport.. ( the passport is slimmer and shorter than onetouch ... maybe thats why..**SOFTWARE**My experience has not been much good.. i could not register my product for some days.. the screen got white and did not show anything.. there is no free backup software.. you are asked to backup on gdrive, dropbox or onedrive.. no recovey tool included.. i think it is a paid service ..not sure about the last one..cant say about the software experience on onetouch.. didnt see it.. but it includes 3 months adobe cc if you are into this..**RELIABILITY**Now the big part.. This is the only reason  i bought this one.. otherwise i would no doubt go for the onetouch.. seagate drives tend to fail twice as much as wd drives.. so i could not take risk.. many claim seagate has now learnt from their mistake and d is falling behind by staying in the top spot.. cant say about the first sentence, but quite sure about the second..**MISC**Came with no bubble wrap.. only a plastic tray which was maybe well enough..cable could be a bit better..onetouch\\'s one had grip for pulling it out and seemed better..Has fine texture on body so no fingerprint..onetouch and this one both are same price.. you can go for anyone of these..Sorry for the long review.. But i wanted to tell the buyers the complete story.. would update my review later..,Amzon realy amzing service... If not discount but amzon not provide fake! so i like to buy Amzon product.. 5TB WD Hard Drive Amazing,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The HDD is compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around with me. It is also very easy to use - all I had to do was plug it in and it was ready to go.The 2TB of storage space is more than enough for my needs, and it is a great way to store and back up all of my important data. The HDD is also very fast, which makes transferring files a breeze.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of this 2TB external HDD. It is a reliable and convenient to store and back up my data, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of additional storage space.,,Good quality,Happy with this product. Very nice. Do not forget to buy its case separately.,Product is good,It heats up quickly. Totally worth it! Product is quality is good and beyond expectation in such a price range. Wish company has added other features and some add on in quality and more megapixels to it.Best buy for students and working professionals, but don\\'t consider it for buying if you are into content creation and for your organisation.My overall rating is 4.2 out of 5 !!,Value for money,Google meet par chalaya tha photo thik thak aa raha hai.,Used for online examination. Good product!!,Good pic quality,Image and video call quality improve afterall its hd camera gives better output than laptops original basic camera. Inbuilt mic quality is nice and noise cancellation working fine.,I paid Rs 1,199.00 for it on on 29 Sep, 2019. The cam\\'s design is streamlined and sophisticated, and the plug-and-play feature is quite useful. It was a great option at a price of ₹ 1,199 in 2019 but now there are better options available. Don\\'t fall for good reviews most of them are old.Be smart you can use the Droidcam software to configure your Android phone as a webcam if you have brief video calls, such as an interview or exam. A Lenovo 300 FHD webcam with a \"wide-angle\" vision and stronger mics makes more sense if you want to invest a little money. Spend the money on Logitech C920 or C922 if you really want to start a live stream or tutorial videos that are more professional; you won\\'t regret. If you already have a point and shoot camera or DSLR at home, get a cheap capture card so you can set it up as a webcam.Pros:Simple plug-and-play is available.The camera offers a regular mode and a wide angle option.The Universal Clip prevents the robust cam from toppling.The green led indicates whether or not the camera is active.Cons:Incompatible with bezel-less displays.The picture and mic quality is poor.Face recognition is too bad.The image will be grainy and noisy.₹ 1,699  seriously no!!!!Conclusion:Choose it if there is no better choice available between ₹500 and ₹1200. It will assist you momentarily. You need enough lighting, and you shouldn\\'t rely on the webcam\\'s microphone.,Does the job. Easy to install.Working great, recommended for light use.If you want to use hard disks without lagging then i will suggest to buy self powered usb hub,The product does what it is intended to do....however, it does not compliment the sleek laptop I use it with.  Probably a direct plug in extension (no cord) would be a much better option.,Needed a portable USB extension. Headphones, keyboard and mouse. Serves the purpose for an indoor setting. Have explained why it is not an outdoor device under the cons.Pros:- Nice design, Sleek, unobtrusive suits some work environments. For those who have limited table estate, go for models that have vertical USB slots, saves space. This is for those who can have it flat next to the laptop/computer. (check image)- Works well for Audio, HIDs, and great for Data Transfer.Observation:- An interesting observation when using usb keyboard, the USB drive is as if not more sensitive than direct typing. With mechanical USB keyboards there is a latency but chiclet and USB Dongle based wireless keyboards seem to work well.- USB or wireless USB (RF) mouse works perfectly. Very little noticeable latency- Not for gaming purposes (keyboards/mice/joysticks etc.). This is a no brainer. In rapid response gaming environments were latency is life or death. An extension is not an option.Cons: (Check Image)The USB female slots in the extension are shallow. The male plugs do not go in fully. There is 0.5 cm of the metal plug exposed. This may be a risk in exposed/outdoor environments. Humidity increases the chances of electric shock, and dust being an insulator may cause static electricity build up. The worst case is if a conductor falls across the exposed points, the whole system can short out.Suggest the designers take this into consideration for their next batch of products. The depth of the USB slots needs to accommodate the full length of the USB plugs.Functionally it works, design leaves a lot wanting. Go for it if are sure you can be safe, go for a different model if you need this for outdoor use.Update: 15th Nov 2022On connecting the keyboard to the usb drive, there seems to be an increased latency and sometimes the keyboard does not respond as anticipated. The text does not appear on the screen immediately and sometimes a particular letter just cascades repeatedly, and one has to press backspace often to delete the excess letters. For data transfer it works fine but has lower speeds, when all four slots are being used. Expected probably!,Works well and does the job.,I like it very much.Value for money...,Product is excellent. Just that wire is very short ! Rest all good,Using in laptop,Useful USB multiplier and works well for headsets too ( was apprehensive earlier if it deteriorates the audio quality)Only drawback is the length of cable as it keeps protruding out of Laptop bag Overall a nice thing to have. But it would be better if you could provide a holder for this particular black varient of case cover.,Good,Value for money,I like the quality is above expectation. You can buy this product. Your laptop will be save from scratches and damages,It\\'s a good product anyone can go for it.,worth the price..soft,thick and good cushioning as per the price.,Built quality of product is excellent,User friendly and nice to hold. After testing a couple of times It seemed as if the fans didn\\'t impact the cooling experience as much as I\\'d hope and most of the work was done by the stand raising the laptop itself.This laptop\\'s fans started failing a couple of months after purchase and now make quite an annoying noise, hence, referring my above statement, if you experience this noise, it would be best to just leave it turned off if you don\\'t care about the small additional cooling.,It do cooling but not that like I was expecting.,Quality is nice, having 5 fans n two separate controls. 1 controls four fans n 2nd control for middle fan. so depending upon laptop battery n cooling required, power can be distributed. built quality is good although it is very light weight. design is superb. having two usb ports so even one fails, second would be avail. which will increase life of this product. its throwing really cool air through small honeycombs, can feel with hands. so its cooling my laptop really well. just i had a small issue about fans that sometime if pad gets tilted before starting, i have to tap it lightly to start it. may be its a balancing issue. but its not much problem for me as it occurs only sometimes n it works very well all time. so recommend everyone to buy.,Good product,I like the product and the performance also. But the cost is too high, I think they need to reduce the price according to the performance,For Office Use it is good, Adjustable is slightly okayBuild Quality and Fan Quality is good Best for Price,1200-1400 RPMLooks goodQuality is also goodNot for heavy gamingI am using it for video editing (premier pro),Works fine but fan sound is high.. This is good. Very light and thin. But, if gap visible when your screen closes very tightly.,Need of this didn\\'t occur to me till I watched Snowden (2016) recently :/,Design and hence operation are superb!,They work for what they are designed for.,Its meant to cover your Privacy and it does well :)Very slim and Adhesive is also good enough and sticks around .I Applied it on my Dell Latitude 7490 and only observation is while closing lid i kinda feel its not properly closed and locked . Well this wont be a problem when you shutdown the Laptop (consider this with a touchscreen laptop would be slight cumbersome) .Anyways Satisfied with the main purpose to Protect privacy :),Good adhesion but doesn\\'t fit all the laptop\\'s cameras.,Good but it Little bump but use full for security purposes,Worth buying... it does the job I wish it would have come up with the feature of auto switch off. As of now it\\'s manual. It kills battery.,Overall good for normal work,It\\'s so smooth to use this. No pressure on hands.,Mouse is working very fine and look also awesome but little small.,Used it for a while and it always court people’s attention because of nice design but not made for gaming for sure.,Good,Performance is good but the mouse is so slim that it feels uncomfortable because I am not used to holding such slim mice!I just received it and posting my initial thoughts...will have to see if I get used to holding it!,Very smooth, sleek and beautiful, matched my silver black laptop colors. at Rs.319 it\\'s a great deal. I use it for mobile vlogging.,Noice cancellation is not working,Value of money 💰,Good mike, worth money,Very nice mic in this price range.,After seeing many microphone. I found thisI bought it becuase of its good ratings and reviews and in a buget price. This is best for beginners,The first time I had ordered this mic, I received in a amazon plastic bag and the product box inside was completely damaged and was sealed using cello tape. Also, the mic seller sent me was damaged and had low quality audio. It was a duplicate.But, when I replaced, I received the packing in a cardboard box but still the inner box had a few damages.The mix received inside was good.Here is a detailed review of the mic:1. The quality: Quality overall nice. The wire might seem filthy and weak but in reality when I tested it, it was indeed a bit durable. It can easily sustain a bit of a pull and twist. Just mind the spots when the wire meets the audio jack and the mic2. Sound quality: Sound quality is really nice. BUT BUT BUT... before you think of buying it, read the paragraph below (of noise cancellation). The mic catches sound equally even if you are from far away or close to it.3. Noise Cancellation: This is a major point. I used to mic a lot for testing purposes. Let me share my experience. I tested it in different environments.a. In a closed room with AC and total silence: In such environment, you will get crisp sound like a boom microphone. But, you will also receive a bit of white noise or background static noise which you can easily reduce using the noise reduction feature.b. In a room with ceiling fan on and moderate noise: Still seems good but not great. Your vocals would still be crispy and clear but the background noise will increase. Still if you use nice noise reduction software (like Audacity) it will sound great. Adding background music to your video would help.c. In a room with standing fan on and high noise: Not recommended at all. Not only this mic but any mic would capture a TON of noise. To express statistically, there will be atleast 40% noise of wind whooshing in the background.d. The same high noise room with windows open: You will die doing noise reduction. Not gonna lie, the background noise increases by 60 times.  DONT TRY THIS.The pop filter or the sponge on the top of the mic helps a lot. When you are speaking close to the mic, a lot of air goes in while speaking. So, when the \"filter\" is attached, the output sound does not have air whooshing but with the filter removed, the output sound is only air.Now, to sum up...Mic is overall good. Noise cancellation is not great but yeah, for the price range, it is the best!Recording tips:1. Record in a silent room with A/C or else turn on the fan at the least speed so it doesn\\'t make much noise.2. Use the collar clip to place the mic, don\\'t hold it in hand. ( I mean this is common sense :-P )3. If transmission lines (electricity wires which are above the head) go from close to your room, I would recommend changing rooms.Now, the reason for this is that sometimes, the mic can catch electromagnetic intefrerence.  This maono mic won\\'t catch it but I recommend this for generic mics.4. Do noise reduction in Audacity. It is very effective than the inbuilt noise reduction tools in video editors. Also, it is very easy.Also, BOYA BY-M1 MIC SOUNDS ALMOST THE SAME AS THIS MIC. There is only like 2% difference in noise cancellation. But, I would still give both of them 3 stars for noise cancellation.THAT\\'S IT!Hope you understand what I mean to say.Peace out.,Nice 🙂 It was easy to assemble. The manual explains the procedure of assembly for both with and without resting pad. And the height can be adjusted accordingly. Just felt it is not sturdy enough.,The product packaging was good and clean. While assembling, I could see there are minute scratches. Other than that, it looks good and sturdy!,Good One , using for office work and my wife using for vegetable cutting purpose also.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/61uDjA3dINL._SY88.jpg,Could have been more sturdy and the fittings attached to the table top are easily felt which feels cheap. Pro\\'s are: Good for WFH and if you have budget constraint. Angles and height adjustment is best. You can easily adjust the height to any chair you are using.,Good,, Sufficient length,excellent build quality ,good alternative to generic cables,Strong cable, the cable ends are nearly like rubber. GOLD coated. Cable is also of high thickness.,Why I bought this ?I have DVR rack, for DVR which is far above the reach limit hence I need a mouse to be connected to the USB port of the DVR which is in the rack above reachAny alternatives?Wireless mouse didn\\'t work well with my particular DVR, had lots of lag,  hence I had to resort to a USB port extender with ample lengthResult :Very sturdy cable able to connect to my DVR and connection is stable .Amazon basics is very reliable.,This cable is good for any device that needs extension over USB 2.0 like printers, TVs, gaming consoles, keyboards etc.The build quality is good. Cable material is soft so it will not break. Connectors are gold plated and will not rust.But remember, this cable will not give USB 3.0 speeds even if you connect it to a USB 3.0 port.,For Usb 2.0 , any usb 3.0 if used will behave as usb 2.0Type: ADirection: female to maleFunction: extension of length of usbBuilt: average  not cloth/fibre braiderLength: as mentionedWorks for all connections: yes [including pc\\\\printer\\\\console pen drive etc ],Product is as per description,Good as expected. When you use its okay product.,I am using and don\\'t find any problem 🤠,Nice product, good quality and easy to manage,The best thing about it is that its super light weight and small.. so its wasy to carry almost everything,Go for itGood for landscape mode,I liked low price.,Nice,Ok This is review is primarily focused on sound quality.The term Bass is used losely. One doesn\\'t expect true Bass from such small drivers.SHORTER VERSION:Boat Stone 650: Very loud. Loud and somewhat uneven bass. Mids are a bit supressed. Somewhat muffled midrange. Decent treble. A loud bassy speaker.Nakamichi Speck: Barely louder than the 3W Stone 200. Mids clearer than 650. Bass much much lower than 650. If looking for VFM rule this one out, unless this is on a big discount and others aren\\'t. Overall fairly even sound, at a questionable price and volume.Boat 200: More bass than expected of a tiny 3W speaker, but lesser than Speck, and way lesser than 650. Excellent midrange and terble. Much lounder than what you may expect of a 3W speaker. Amazing speaker in a tiny package, with insufficent bass.LONGER VERSION:I have had the 200 for years and many have asked me to order it for them. It is an excellent tiny satisfying package. The midrange, vocals and treble is excellent, and matches speakers several times it price. If bass is not what you are after, you are unlikely to find a better package even at a much higher price point, especially if you care for even sound.(By Even Sound, I mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well - no major suppression or enhancement)I checked the others as I usually hear music on a semi-pro system, and the insufficent bass (lower-mids) bothered me.Nakamichi USED to be a Japanese company making very high end tape decks in the 90s so the benchmarks were high (now it is a China based company). The 25W raised expectations further. As said, it is barely louder than the 3W Stone 200. It is fairly even sound, but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the 200. If you don\\'t care about the money, and want something better, than the 200 with even sound, this could be it. The mids and terble, are a tiny bit better in the 200. Speck also has a larger battery, giving substantially longer backup, and better water protection (useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house :) )The Stone 650 is miles ahead in bass and loudness. if that is what you care for, amongst the 3 - your choice is simple. The bass is uneven, however. All three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators. One should not expect much nuance in bass from those. If a thump is what you care for - yes it is certainly there (for the size). With somewhat uncontrolled bass, the midrange is compromised - somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled. No, it is not major, and many mgiht not even really notice it much. The transiton between mid and lower-mids/bass isn\\'t great. One usually doesn\\'t expect as much from such speakers, but the Boat Stone 200 set the bar high - very high.Keep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers (speaker) are in the direction of your ears. It makes the midrange a bit better. Reduces the bass a bit, but makes the sound more even. Tough it is impractical to keep it so, it makes the sound a lot closer to what I desire.SOME EXTRAS:Placement of these speakers makes a big difference. Keep them about 6\" away from a wall (ideally a corner) for enhanced bass and fuller sound.If you look at teardown videos, you\\'ll notice that the 650 has much bigger magnets than the others. It is a heavy speaker. I like that, since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further. It is well designed, except the + and - volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive use.The 650 can also be placed vertically. That too changes the sound. Lesser bass, and possibly a bit clearer on the whole (reduced bass = less intrusion into the mids, in such speakers)Speaker characterics change subtly over 100 odd hours of use. Often quite prominent in the first hour, so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hour.Conclusion:Nakamichi Speck: More even sound than the other two, not at all as loud as expected, better waterprof rating, bigger battery, high priced, despite Chinese - Buy if you don\\'t care for the money, volume and are okay wihtout much bass.Boat Stone 200: it is a star! Excellent even sound, however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back. If you are on a budget, or if you don\\'t care much for bass (especially for lectures/documentaries or vocal music) this is brilliant. I have used it for long.Boat 650: Heavy. Loud. Lots of bass. If you can deal with the somewhat (and it is not big) unevenness and slightly muffled sound - it is a good package.For my needs, I added the 650 to my equipment list, while keeping the 200.PS: This was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews I have gained from.,Sound,Its okay to buy,Sound is not much loud, its below my expectations,1. Low price2. Awesome sound3. Battery life should be more so cutting down 1 star but overall good4. Gives feeling of home theatre5. Multiple connectivity is also good.,Loved the product,, I can say costly, although it can do the job,I like the modal and size,,i bought this one year ago, just reviewing now, i carried this to Europe and UK. It\\'s still working good. very good product.,my adapter fallen from charging point its not working,Useful product for international travellers but a little in the expensive side,Quality of the product is not upto the mark, I have uploaded some pictures pls guys check this before you buy.,very good product verified the purchase Bought at 800.Sound quality is good enough.Easy control buttons. It would be better if button are given in a different colour rather than in same colour.Looks good in colour, shape and size.Best part is the battery as it lasts longer.Suggested to buy this at a cost below 1000.,It is good but battery life is dam not good if u play in full volume only 3-5 songs will be played and when comes to bass sound goes down,battery wast,It\\'s battery life is good, atmost 4-5hrs.But sound quality is not as I was expecting but it\\'s ok.,Can buy for picnic and small drives,Not have loudsound,Good connectivity and sound quality is also good according to value cost of product,Good for carry Product quality is not that much good you have to work with lite hand if you put your hand on it and starts drawing or writing it will cause bending in pad,Overall nice product,Nice product,brightness was not upto the mark,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GD+NNhszL._SY88.jpg,Nice i will give 4 star,Overall product is nice but screen is a little bit smaller but in this price range it is okay...go for it guys!!!!!.....,Worth it. Good value of money if u have students at home,Liked it,Good product,Product was good 👍🏻value for moneySheets thickness was good bright in color,Value of money...,black  and dark blue paper not supplied  as it should be also there making it 4x12,These papers are of excellent quality. I\\'ve used many colour sheets before for school projects and the colour used to fade while applying glue. But these color sheets dont have that problem. Definitely must buy if you are looking for a A4 size colour papers for school projects,Quality is good... Especially for kids project... Got it timely Working as described but too early to comment .,Easy to install and performance under observation.Request to hold return instruction and reordering for replacement,No manual intervention needed, it works seamlessly when power cuts happened, Provides 1-30 to 2 hours backup,I bought 4 of these UPS for my home and it works perfectly as explained. No drop in internet speed while on UPS. Modern and router never disconnect also.I have tested this UPS without electricity for 3 hours, by that time electricity came so don\\'t know about full backup.Good UPS and works fine.,TLDR1.battery backup good.2.Small comfyCons1.IT REBOOTS THE WIFI EVERYTIME WHEN THERE IS POWER CUT,Superb product, when it stopped working, the manufacturer got is repaired and sent me back. After that, the backup is also good around 2.5 hrs.,Working as expected so far. On power cut automatically switches to ups mode. It gives me backup for around 6 hours for my huawei router. After few months of usage will update the review accordingly. 1 year home pick up warranty is the usp for this device.,We do not have a inverter installed because our apartment building has DG backup. But it took a few seconds for the DG to turn on due to which my router turned off. So this device works perfectly well to cover the few seconds of no electricity. It may last for hours as they advertise. I had to buy a power splitter cable because I run the media and router both with this backup device and they both work perfectly fine during powercuts. After I changed from my slow 500gb HDD to this SSD feels like I was living in a stone age. My PC started to run as smoothly as I could have ever imagined. Although I am not a gamer but can differentiate the performance of my experience. One who wants to try out the SSD should have this one as the perfect choice,Confusing which one buying but after buying this one is best and speed up my pc. Packaging like no value for money box is band from corner,I found the start-up of the SSD slower , like if u turn on a pc the first thing that kicks in motherboard then GPU/ cup and right after that the SSD in this case i found the SSD took about 2 seconds and a delayed response to startup ,but when ever it didn\\'t start it was quick , don\\'t know probably an issue with my psu or something,Hands down, Go for it.Quite nice, sleek design.Build material is plastic.But one thing I found odd is that the HDD cover that when I put on it and when applied screws then the screws was very hard to put. Last holes were a little misaligned. But after a little bit of force it fits.,Bought this product in Nov 2022. Easy to install and the performance is good.,I installed into my 12yr old desktop, now my i3-540 is showing it\\'s level best. Compared to my old HDD, it\\'s superb to use.Go for it without any second thought.One suggestion, if just buying to boost performance and for desktop, go for 240GB version to keep the OS and keep the existing HDD as well attached as extended internal drive.,Used to upgrade the speed and performance of my old laptop. Works as expected,At first i would like to suggest to look for the rating of the seller selling electronic products, before ordering this i ordered a similiar product crucial ssd500gb but instead i got a toshiba hdd of 500 gb that too loaded with photo and word document of some guy. I contacted amazon and they refunded me right away. Then i placed this order after searching for rating of this seller, which i found legit.. The SSD is good, i installed it in my asus laptop, the laptop is running with 10gigs of ram, i3 gen8 processor, and this ssd, after installing it boot up within 20-30seconds, whereas my previous hdd takes nearly about 3-5minutes. I liked because it was aesthetically pleasing.I thought it was thicker. But overall it ok. Go for it.,You can buy but don\\'t go for printing,It is a short copyYou can use it as a diary😀,Like its sharpness and style,Liked it,Product is good ...but I thought it is a A4 pad. But o k..Small but Good.,,Notebook is good i bought it around 2000 rs and i have been using for around a month. i feel this is good product and nice for office work from home. the space is good for laptop 13 inc and remaining space can be used for phone and other small utilities. Fan i haven\\'t tried because i have macbook.,Great useful one for WFM persons .especially my wife like it thank u,Great produce. Easy to use. Comfortable.,u cant use mouse on this table if ur laptop is 15.6... initially it was fine but after 15days of usage .. when i connect my mouse for gaming or editing its not comfortable..... like mouse on bed and laptop 1 ft above,It helped me a lot for my 2 months working from bed. They can improve on sturdiness a bit, but overall good quality product and better price than all other products. Fits good for 15 inch laptop without mouse. I used mouse on bed as it wont fit on the same table after keeping my 15 inch laptop. Gr8 angle adjustment. I recommend it for friends and family,I like this product, but if it has 2 fans it would so nice because 1 fan is not enough for heavy work or more hours of work. And also fans place if it’s some what moved to the right side instead of mostly to the left side, then the laptop gets the air correctly so laptop don’t get much heat.,I am writing this review after using this table for 8 months ,it is very convenient ,the table doesn\\'t shake even if we use it on bed ,corners of the table are smooth and th material is really of good quality,And the fan is really handy ,Even i use the use this table as a cooling pad by folding and the legs and just put it on the table ,but only when we are watching videos and not typing ,ot else it will be shakey ,Over all I am happy ,that my money didn\\'t not got waste because i search for a table there are other brand for even less price like 500/-,but I choose this thinking that it is a once time investment and i need to buy and item which is durable and i bought this ,and i am happy with my decision,I like it , only thing is little bit smaller than others and i don\\'t find any use of fan. This is an amazing Bluetooth earphone for its price 500 it\\'s good sound,good battery but only problem is there it\\'s band as its flexible it dosent stay at place when in neck they go over another. Otherwise it\\'s an amazing earphone. If your budget is low then buy this it\\'s good.,Bought this product 2 months ago and it is working perfectly fine . Only sometimes it connects to more than one device . Else all things are good,Purchased this product for it was available for immediate delivery. The product appears cheap, but holds well. Sound quality is alright for basic requirements,,Nice Bluetooth 👍👍,NICE PRODUCT IN 450 RS,, BATTERY BACKUP IS AWESOME,,FAST CHARGING,,,SOUND IS ALSO VERY GOOD,,ONLY BASS NOT AVAILABLE AND TYPE C PORT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS NECK BANDOVERALL GOOD PRODUCT,Sound and connectivity is very good but after 5 month it\\'s not charging. No use for long life. Not a good product,Worth nice design and print. But hard to differentiate between the ocean and nonocean areas, the color shading of countries could\\'ve been better otherwise all is good.,Had Purchased this recently for a secret santa gifting , Worth the price and also the other person liked the product too much,Expensive but nice product,I was looking for a desk mat which is anti skid and this product match the expectations. I tried few other mats which was mentioned anti skid and also price was almost double of this mat price but it was not at all anti skid.

Uncompleted this product,Best i get.. in the segment... Next is depend on performance Nice product,short wired atleast give 2 meter wire,Sound quality  is good,Was looking for a laptop speaker for remote work for few months, something sounds louder than my laptop. I bought this with very very low expectations. BUT!!, Sound quality is not that bad. okay for casual music and podcasts listening. sound is fine and clear in 60%volume range. Vocals are clear. bass is neither present or absent. Enough for desktop listening while working. Max volume is useless. Still great buy for the price. No complaints.,Good product,Bass is not high,Love it, Product is good. But the brightness is not that much enough.,Very good and engaging tablet for small kids. Totally worth the money,Lightness , average bright,Very economical nd handy for kids,The concept is good but product quality is not the best,Good for gifting.

The cable build quality is good for normal charging its great cable but doesn’t support quick charging,Works for charging but other applications are hit or miss.Example my external keyboard doesn\\'t work with it!,Best quality and length of wire was qute good and durability also good .,The cable is awesome and no charging issue till now.... Because it is a braided cable... Chance of it damage are very less... Overall... I like the product 🤞🏻,Using this cable from past 40 days to charge lg g7thinq and samsung s21fe.  So far super,Good,Seems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough / base of the pin is too thick that i couldn\\'t insert it into my phone\\'s charging port without removing the case!,Over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin ₹99 me 1.5m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai. Maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai. Agar ₹150 me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai. I have purchased for my camera assceres like battery small lens and cables.  I totally satisfied for the purchase,WD Harddisk is faster as compare to others. It is light weight. Design is good. Performance is very nice,I want new hard disc,Really good portable hdd with 1.5 tb storage and speed of 112 approx mb/sec,Data transfer speed is very faster than expected. It runs very smoothly and size is very small. So its easy to cary and moving.,Nice,,Got a little scratched product ( * Not noticeable in normal view and just 1 scratch so not complaining. Got this for 3100-3200₹. Storage capacity showing 1.37tb means rest of it maybe for system backup. Took 47sec to transfer 4.16GB data from laptop to drive through 3.0 usb. Happy with the product at first look. Let\\'s see kaise chalta h.. you can go for this under 3600₹ bcz no one is giving you 1.5tb at this range and remember 1.5TB means you will get less than 1.4 and 1TB means less than 960gb, That\\'s how it is 🙂. Quality of product is above average.,Good quality product,  little bigger than expected,  please check the size before buying.,Value for money but need to see it\\'s durability, just got the item,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71YNj3dABEL._SY88.jpg,Its HUGE well at list i didn\\'t think it be this big worth buying it, its durable and looks great.,Writing this review after 3 years of using almost every day, no tears or undoing of the stitching. Works as intended.,I bought this mouse pad 2 or 3 years before and it\\'s really good. Had no issue while playing games. You can consider this movie pad if you want 👍🏻,Best quality... And size is also according to my need.. best product at this price Had zero expectations when bought it. Neither disappointed nor am I happy.The most important flaw there are times I forget to switch it off. it stays switched on throughout. If you have a big palm then it is going to give you aches after a few hours of use.Rest is all good.,Product is fine at this cost,It\\'s smooth,Its a good wireless mouse but sometimes lags when I do heavy tasks like video editing.It doesn\\'t have sleep feature LED glows all the time.Don\\'t have low battery indicator light.,Best mouse,Nice,Good,Working as it should be. No issues with reception and latency. I bought it when I watched an instagram influencer showed this product and wanted to try hands on this.Quality wise it\\'s really good and since it\\'s made by Logitech which has been in the market from too many years in PC Accessories - so less doubtful about it\\'s durability. The best features once you pair your 3 different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth, switching connectivity is super fast - like you won\\'t feel any lag in connectivity. The instructions strap helps to well understand this product. I bought at 2.6k, but I know it\\'s price had dropped to 1.7K during Diwali Sale.Things I hate about this product -- I felt it would be light-weight but it isn\\'t.- Buttons are rounded (but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great)- For gaming, buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which don\\'t matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys (it\\'s always WASD), but yes will be problematic if you play FIFA where there is extreme usage of arrow keys.So, 4/5 for overall experience.,Good portable keyboard. I can list out the pros and cons.Pros -1. Good Connectivity with Macbook pro latest OS2. Macbook keys are mapped properly as expected.3. Portable4. Simultaneous connectivity with 3 devicesCons-1. Not an ergonomic keyboard. Its flat and doesn\\'t have any option to incline up.2. Dont have backlight keys. You can not see the keys in dark room.3. Keys are slightly hard to press, I think due to rubber dome.4. Enter key, I feel, is smaller which cant be sensed without seeing the keyboard.Overall, my purpose got fulfilled as i am able to use it with my Macbook pro after struggling with logitech R270 combo.,The keyboard is really good and it has a good built quality and the only con is that there is no indication of whether the caps lock is on or off.,Pros: easy to use, keys feels like mechanical keyboard. Can connect 3 devices. Supports Mac and windows. Place holder for mobile devices ( However, I use it to place a pen)Cons: Expensive. Very heavy ( feels like Macbook air). There is lag in connection whenever you turn on your laptop.,price is litter high,What an excellent product I got my hands on. Smooth working and connect to 3 different gadgets at the same time and u can work on any of them. Buttons are of good size so typing is easy and fast. The inbuilt holder for gadgets is really solid and helping. And it\\'s connect to IPhone also.,Only uses for typing if horizontal view is suitable to see what we typingThink twice before buying,Not working properly on macbook pro! Switches to junk characters frequently which is really frustrating!How did I fix ?The keyboard switches to symbol/junk characters when the option key is pressed. So, I had to disable the option key in the keyboard and live with it!Apart from that above problem, It\\'s a good looking keyboard. The keys are smooth to handle. Due to its container for tablet/phones, the product is not as compact as you might be expecting. Not charging as fast as I\\'d have expected. Maybe something wrong with my unit. However, the cable overall is actually pretty decent. The material is great, it doesn\\'t bend out of shape very easily, and looks (and feels) premium. The length is definitely a plus!,Good,A sturdy cable for mobile charging.,It\\'s been 1 month that i am using this charging cable, works very well with S20 FE 5G. Thumbs up.,Braided cable is sturdy and built well. Long cable adds extra reach and is tangle free.,A good buy. The extra length helps a lot.,Good product,Ok The 12V product will not work with most type of modems. It\\'s always better to purchase their 12V3A product. I have used 12V2A product for 9 months and it stopped working after that. When I contacted the customer care, they told me that I should have purchased there 3A product. Anyway they have provided the warranty. Also provided an option to upgrade the product to 3A at a discounted rate instead of replacing the current one.,The product is good. Will require an additional Y splitter cable.,Product is very good,using since 2nd Dec 2022, no issues.,Value for money. Effective in cutting off and cutting in, during an outage. Normal router can be supported by up to 2-3 hours on this, even after 2 years of use. If there is not much power outage, recommend to at least switch off power supply a couple of times every month and have the battery support this for a couple of hours,Purchased ups 12v3A, Works fine with jio fibre (12v2.5A) and provide good backup, but little costly as compare to ups 12v2A (which is not compatible with my jio fibre.,I ordered 12V, 2A model for my Digisol wifi.After installation the product was turning off once the power goes.So i called Resonate customer care and they told as your DIGISOL wifi is not supports 12v 2a  and they suggested to buy a 12V 3A ups.Before purchase please call Resonate customer care,Amazing product very helpful at times off power cut.,This is best to avoid power cut issues, pretty decent power backup for home wifi It\\'s a good product but the paper sometimes  dosent  stick on surfaces for more then 2 times.,Nice sticky notes,Pros: Quantity and ColorsCons: the adhesive strength is almost non existent.Its just paper cut outs,Has 3M adhesive,good,Not up to mark,Worth to sticky.. helped me a lot in remembering mindmaps, its value for money , its good for students and for causal writers , overall best build quality , stable , and sturdy .,Good,Prize is higher side!,It is a very good product for WFH and study, but the edges are very sharp. Couldn\\'t read for a long time. Hands are scratched. So it is not a good product for kids.,Very good,Stability sturdiness are quite impressive.,Easy to handle,good product,  i am satisfied I\\'ve been using the watch for a while now and I got to say I love it. The battery lasts around 4-5 days not 10 days, you do get around 10 day battery life if you disable all features of the Watch. Overall I like the call quality and display touch.,I got this product today and watch is great in budget and performance there\\'s only one major problem that the button is not good but the other things are like speaker mic display etc. Are good.,The watch is good but the product that I got was defective after talking to the fire bolt company they give me new watch watch is value for money go for it.,The watch is stylish sleek and built quality is good.in this price range it\\'s a catch,All over good but volume increase and decrease not working while play the music.,I gv this feedback after using 3 months.. good watch. Lekin jab recive kia, watch on tha☹️ pm me Alarm lagana bohut zaroori hota he. But nhi lagte he. Sirf am me lga skte hai. very disappointed😖 baki battery backup is good 👍 looks achcha hai👌comfortable hai,It’s a good watch but not switching on right now due to some issue,Amazing watch amazing colour! Just bought yesterday, will share feedback again after the usage. I have received this product with a torn packet, missing cable and user manual. It seems incomplete product. And the same airtel sim gives me a strong network but here I foud it slower than my mobile network. It\\'s fine, it might be the problem of network, but the cable shouldn\\'t be missing. It seems someone taken while shipping because I got the packet broken. However, I received the WiFi with battery. And I use my own cable to charge it.,Overall satisfied,Nice working,I faced Much tower problem,It is better than mobile hotspot, but it\\'s battery backup is not good.,Even with a 4G SIM the network speed is really low and connection is patchy. Its ok if you are using it for personal surfing but not a good fit for office work.,Satisfied with the product.,When i connect only 1 device then ok. But when multiple device connecting, it is hitting abnormally within 1 minute. Then backup reduce maximum 3-4 hours. The cable looks exactly as it is shown in the picture. I can\\'t say about durability of this product because I have purchase this on 15th December 2022After 3 to 4 months I will update my review about the durabilityAnd the cable works fine,good one,Used it for a long time had no complains.,Good,Thanks,Works well,Perfect for laptop charging,It\\'s good to have it for 200 rs. Delivered in 3 days EDIT: This doesn\\'t change my review (actually, it probably makes it lean even heavier towards the 4 star than 3 star rating) but I actually sat on the keyboard while it was on my chair (I\\'m an absolute unit of a dude weighing 120kg) and the keyboard wasn\\'t affected at all. I\\'m genuinely surprised.First of all, I\\'d give this a 3.5/5 instead of the 4 but I rounded it up instead of down because there\\'s more to like than dislike.Product was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape. When I unpacked it, the keyboard had three missing keys (iirc it was left Alt, Z and the Windows keys). I turned over the box and dumped everything and voila! The missing keys fell out. Not off to a great start but I slapped those keys on (which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy) and plugged in the receiver to my laptop. No setup or 3rd party software necessary, it just started working instantly. Pretty seamless.I only use the keyboard when I connect my laptop to my TV and I\\'m sitting at a distance, I use my laptop\\'s keyboard otherwise. I absolutely love the keyboard. I was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent. It\\'s not super premium but it\\'s much better than what I was expecting for the price. It has flip stands on the back to raise it and an on/off switch if you want to conserve battery. The keys themselves are full sized, and as someone with larger hands, I really appreciate it. The curve around the space bar looks cool but I don\\'t think it adds anything ergonomically. The typing experience is nice, the keys have enough feedback to them (not mechanical levels obviously, but still satisfying enough). The Caps Lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and don\\'t accidentally hit it while typing, neat little addition. The shortcut/media keys on top all work fine with Windows 11. There\\'s not much else to say about the keyboard. It should be more than sufficient for everyday office/browsing/school tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot. Do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting, etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard. I was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget, that\\'s understandable and acceptable. Overall, I very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you pay.The mouse, on the other hand (no pun intended), is mediocre at best. The build quality is not good; it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons, you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning, like it\\'s gonna fall apart at any time. The mouse also starts lagging randomly. The lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance. Also, it just doesn\\'t feel good in your palm. I have an Amazon Basics mouse that I purchased while I was in the US for $7 (~520rs) and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this. It also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of use.As an overall package, I would say it\\'s decent for the price. There are lots of other sets in this price range and I picked this literally because of the Logitech branding since I own a few other Logitech products and enjoy them a lot. The keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying it\\'s mouse friend. I hope they improve the mouse going forward because then, this would be the best combo in this range. As it stands right now, it\\'s fairly indistinguishable from its competitors.Recommended for - people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lot.Not recommended for - gaming or any form of power users. It might work for single player games like city builders, grand strategy, RTSes, etc but I would not recommend it for any form of shooters, especially online. The mouse simply isn\\'t up to task.,,The Keyboard is good and working nice. for me the Mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only. it will be good if the mouse is in regular size. Also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settings.,I using this product since one year not any problem found.Even battery cell not change,I don\\'t really know if it\\'s worth the cost or not. But, I mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks. Ergonomic is also a must as I use these for long hours.Currently, I use logitech m590 mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at all.,Great Product,I have been using this product for 2years. It\\'s battery is great, still running. The keys could get hard with time, therefore i had to use WD-40 to lubricate them. After 2years, some random keys have stopped working, such Del, Semicolon, Numpad-3. The mouse\\'s right click isn\\'t functioning anymore. The left click has irritating double click issue. So not suited for FPS games. Speed and connection is adequate, no lag noticed. The keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it. Ergonomics are great no issue with that. If you\\'re looking for a longer size keyboard for approx. 2years of proper functioning for daily or official use, then it is a good purchase. Mouse is small and comfortable, even for left handed people. Keep in mind the keys WILL become stiff over time.,I purchased it for my personal use , which includes mostly working, it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse . I have not faced any issue with it. I have not tested its performanace. Very premium and good material use,It\\'s good but one thing I don\\'t like it that phone mount is not good it has broken when I tighting the mount to tripod and when you remove your phone  then you will be seeing some of the scratch or something like this on the back cover.,Good product specially for first time usage people and it\\'s worthy for the price,It\\'s good but after few times using it can\\'t take the weight... but overall it good. I liked it.,good stand .good quality and  finishing also good worth the price.,Overall Good but little high price,This product is best for beginners.  Have some stability issues which you couldn\\'t expect in this price range. Definitely you can go for it.., Really it is solid and effeciant. Net signal is very fast,It\\'s working fine,value for money,Nice product 👍,Idk but my WiFi signal from the router is unstable. I called and got it check from service providers also. But as of now product Seems to be good,Very good quality with good speed,Not good,Everything great from packaging to cable quality Buy it,Received in good condition and is working properly,This price cabil not good,  and also short,I am using from 2 months and charging the phone in good way and it\\'s really value for money.. i recommend this cable.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CEI3G+BLL._SY88.jpg,The cable is perfect for 3A charging devices . Support super fast charging and can be used in vehicle chargers and adapters. sturdy and durable for daily use,Best cable i have ever used by amazon .worth it . Guys just take it,Good Quality.but over priced USB 3.0 pendrive in USB 2.0 Price.However, on connecting to USB 3 in some devices, particularly desktops and All-in-Ones are getting disconnected due to overcurrent protection.However USB 2.0 is not having any such issue.In USB 2.0.

Nice branded product,Value for money (speed is approx 13mb/s),It was a value for money purchase but it was not up to the mark. The transfer speed is not upto its 3.2Gen 1 Specs.I would say OK Ok. I got it for 249rs. With additional GST TAX Etc. Etc. It\\'s total price was 289rs. I bought it from Appario PVT LTD. Using it from last 4 or 5 months. Each cell running long, fast charging..,Newly purchased, Giving good backup,Thanks.,I bought this for my point and shoot camera, I\\'ve been using use and throw Duracell battery which work perfectly. But when these arrived they don\\'t fit in my camera. I ask amazon for a replacement thinking they could be defective, when the replacement arrived, the same thing happened. The batteries wont fit in my camera. Thinking my camera must have some problem I bought ordinary AA (non-rechargeable) from nearby shop and they fit inside nicely. I\\'ve added a photo to compare the slight size difference too. So keep in mind about this if you plan to buy.,Good product,Very good product,but seller don\\'t send me product bill, then how to claim my guarantyee this product..over all good product.,Company claims more than its actual durability,2 Year Old Duracell Battery Delivered. a new level slip is inject with old level slip.. old level slip Mfg Date Is 11-2020 It\\'s a good data cable and I recommend it to purchase,the only issue was the metal pin is not fixed firmly so it has become loose,otherwise no issue,must purchase,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SgnWv1ML._SY88.jpg,Charging cable which is sturdy it\\'s not a fast charging cable but the three outlets does the job.,Good sturdy micro usb cable with good charging speeds. Please don\\'t raise prices,Nice product, a simpla microusb cable,😂,Best for this price,Good one बैटरी के रेट ठीक हैं डिलीवरी ज्यादा है 40 रुपएटोटल 290 ₹ देने पड़े,Charging does not last for more than 3 days with out use after full recharge,battery does not last even one week even in wall clocks,charger is not good because no idicate light after battery fully charge,Get higher wattage..... 1000 too less and required constant charging.,Not even last for 1-2 month in wall clock . Battery leakage is another problemPls don\\'t buy and waste money instead go for good mah and good brands,I have tried changing once only it\\'s ok,1.2 v please check when buying Then this one is for you. It\\'s actually well made and the colour options are pretty catchy. I basically wanted some no silicon tips wired earphones for laptop& cell phone calling. Didn\\'t want to pay more than necessary when I saw these for 200/- grabbed them cause I saw some pretty good reviews and honestly they are good for the money. Love the design. The volume buttons work. Good for casual music sessions. Mic is good too.,They are very good for the price point. But the build quality is just bad. I bought it because it had volume control, even high end earphones lack those nowdays. But the button enclosure feels like cheap plastic and will break easily. It has huge drivers don\\'t get me wrong 14mm for earphones this price is no joke. The bass is also quite good. Go for it only if you have budget restraints.,The quality of sound is good but it\\'s build quality. The wires are very delicate and prone to get bend and break,Sound Quality-GoodMicrophone Clearance-GoodWare Quality-Good & long ware.Design-GoodI Recommends to you....Only i believe amazon.... They will never broke my trust.,Best product in this price.,decent one for the price. so far no issues,Totally worth it ☺️,a Bit loud and the cables are very thin. But for 199 it\\'s good . Good budget mfi certified lightly cable for this price . Update usage review after 3 to 5 months .,Better than the original one in matter of robustness and durability. Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified, It does the job really well. No complaints regarding the charging power. At a price of Rs. 199/-, it is worth every buck. Although this cable is a bit shorter than the original one, but the original OnePlus cable is around Rs.900/-. So there is a huge price difference, and it does the same job as the original one.,Useful for “c” type charging. But not suitable with all adapters or USB points. Serves the purpose.,Sturdily built. Does its job well. Charged my Samsung Galaxy M51 quicker than the original cable. Hope it stays the same going ahead.,Liked the charging speed disliked the length. On iPads this is awesome but it’s is not 6 foot long so this the only point to think otherwise it is the best cable,Good,Everything is good including connectivity and stuff,Nice product..im using this for my car,This product is nice and worth the amount...I recommend it to anyone who are looking for this kind of cable good product value for money,,Good product,Works Well With PlayStation 3, Must Try.,It shorted from the inside. There was no visible damage outside but the cable shorted from inside and sparks started to fly during ordinary use,Nice,Looks sturdy and better quality than the market ones,One of the pins were broken when received and I could see that inside the pins its not metal instead looks like porceline and outside alone a thin ss covering is given. poor quality Achha product hai ...thoda brightness badhane ki jarurat hai ...,After heavy usage for 10days,Pros:1.Battery last2. Brightness depends on the brightness of the place we\\'re using it3. Smooth and Addictive4. Attracts you to scribble something on it5. Best time passMy 3years old boy loves to doodle so to avoid him scribble on everything I bought this for him. Now he lovesssssss to write on it. While other children addicted in mobile📱 I\\'m proud of my kid 😂 but the misfortune is... It addict everyone so when my son busy playing with other toys we started using it.Cons:1. Color started fading i could see some dark blue at bottom as it\\'s somewhat green colour while writing.2. If we write our palm will be visible in this slate. it\\'s really a drawback. Even if we cautious about it, we\\'re helpless.3.Delete button print gone in a day4.Easily get scratch,Size want to big and need more brightness over product is awesome,I like this product,Very nice & satisfactory,Brightness is very low and depends on the ambient light in the room. Otherwise a great product.,Na,It’s a nice product to use and save paper and for this price range I guess it’s the good option. Used for more than a month. Works (HDMI, USB) well so far. Not tested the MicroSD slots.,Build quality is great. I\\'m using this with my MacBook it works fine . While using this adapter Amazon prime videos can\\'t play in 1080p resolution on monitor it says the devices not support hd . Other ports are working fine not a problem.,I took this for my macbook m2 pro 2022 edition and it is working perfectly,all the ports are working fine till now ,it\\'s been 2 month i am using it , length of the wire is little small it could be little big and the price is also little high it could be under 900rs ,then it will justify.,If you bought a MacBook Air or Pro recently and wondering what to do about all the missing ports - USB, HDMI etc, this is your one stop solution.I tried on my MacBook Air M2 and it works like a charm. I connected, various pen drives, disk drives and a 128 go flash drive - all worked fine.Very reasonably priced compared to other options, yet has a fairly good look and feel.,Everything working fine but it doesn\\'t works with Macbook\\'s HDMI when try to connect one plus TV as an extended screen( different displays on both) but works fine if used as second screen with common display.,Solved my problem,I got the product on 11th August 2022. This is the initial impression.1) Packaging - The package I received was in good condition. it had a pre wrapped plastic on the box. No complaint about packaging but one thing to note is that \\'No Brand name on the packaging.\\' Although when you open the product , the brand name is there on the product.2) Build - Wire length is small to my opinion. It has a metal build finish and looks premium and sturdy. Wire quality is also good but at this price should have provided braided cable.3) I have tested this product with 3 usb ports connected - a) Mouse b) Keyboard c)External 2TB SSD. SSD does not get disconnected when all 3 usb are connected. For confirmation i did a 2 gb file transfer and No disconnections were noticed.Note : The Speed of the data transfer is low. I did 2 gb file transfer and was getting the max speed of  39MB/s with the SSD connected through the usb hub.Although when I did the same file transfer by directly connecting the SSD to the laptop port, i got speed of 111 MB/s. So if you want to do lot of file transfer better connect it directly and not through the usb hub.So far initial impression are good, let see how long it last.,Sometimes not detected by MAC and quality is not that good Zebronics Product is always good. I bought this product for my laptop and using everyday for watching movies, hearing Songs...,,The sound is awesome as I recommend this for music purpose as it has medium base but rest of all its awesome,,Sound quality is good .....laptop mai aacha use hota h ....mobile se bhi connect ho jaata h ...pr Bluetooth ni h isme ....charging cable bhi h isme ....mtlb 2 usb port chahiye chalane ke liye,,Wonderful and compact speakers for desktop setup. It completed my gaming setup as my monitor dont have in built speaker was in search of good speakers. These are good in terms of gaming, binge watching or any purpose. liked the design as it splits in to two which gives good sound effect. Totally worth the price.,Good product and good quality. The product is working smoothly with soft slight clicks. Lookwise is stylish at some extent. Handy in use, portable and flexible product. Better product at this price range. If you are looking similar product at this budget then go for it. This is just the initial review at this time. The detailed review will post soon depending on the usage and work. But at this time, I recommend this product.,good justiff its price,Bought two mouse both of them were delivered on time. I have been using them for few months now and they are working fine. Comes with the basis functions, built quality is good and you get 3years warranty which is great for the price.,Ok for normal office use.,Wouldn\\'t say great but okay for the price tag. Overall good for work purposes.,Its a very nice mouse, giving me above 25 cps,And yeah if youre looking for a cheap gaming mouse than go for it. The build quality is very good and having a matt finish.,i got this in 250 and definitely in 250 it works very good, the wire is also long enough and if you love wired mouse....it is good in 250,not proper size ,it should be Littel big Yeah here is the honest review.... Looking good..Quality is OKAY... Not an defective product... But I\\'m not satisfied with the phone holder... It is too straight, because understand the reality,every one will like and feel comfortable when the phone holder is little slope...that comfort is not there... And i added the picture of my vision of the phone on the holder...too straight...It is 😣difficult to see and write... The phone holder is the main purpose for what I buy this... But that is not suitable for me...but the quality of the table is good...,Cushion grip is coming out,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71289Z63rOL._SY88.jpg,The tab/phone holder is not useful ...phone/tab holder doesn\\'t give an angular slant for clear view...it also has a small diameter that could not hold broad tab or phone..,quality stability light weight easy to carry  these r some good points of product,,Such a nice bed & studying table. This is very comfortable. You must be buy.,It\\'s not sturdy on the bedMaterial is cheap. Not as expected Batteries does not charge as per the description, I have charge for more than 8 Hrs for full recharge /to be used properly, after the 8 hrs charges the charging does not last for more than 3 days with out use,I noticed when I got the batteries that they are so much lighter than normal batteries and was suspicious. But after using it heavily, this battery runs out so much quicker than my other 2800mAh battery. Then I saw the back of the case and it was written there it is 1800mAh battery.Everything else works fine as intended but I don\\'t think they should be deceiving customers by giving another product and advertising something else. That is fraud behavior. But for price of 1,099 it is justified.,Getting overheated when charging is on for 1 hour fear of getting melted the body,Good mid speed charger,I am impressed,No Chinese goods are my favourite.,I like the product, am using this for keyboard.,Charging the battery in hours time 1.5 to 2 hrsGood to have oneI am using this charger to charge my existing rechargable batteries both AA and AAA Nice cover but no place for stylus. Then why give stylus pen along with cover if no place to place the stylus?,Value for money product. You get free pen , cheap through but it works. I wish this cover has option to store the pen.Front of the cover looks expensive and top notch however the back plastic feels cheap.Still good buy at its current price.,Case having good quality nd durability need to test, nd pen quality is okok, works well with ipad but afcourse apple pencil is the best.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61RDUgqA0wL._SY88.jpg,Pros1. The case is superb, fits well.2. Looks good too with transparent back3. Is very lightCons1. Might break in a single fall2. Doesn\\'t work as ipad stand3. Gets dirty fast.,The product (black color) well suits my space gray color iPad that gives a rich look. It fits perfectly (power volume buttons, charge earphone ports). It is lightweight. Backside is translucent and strong enough. The magnet is good but less effective if you fixed tempered glass in ur iPad. Stylus pen is moderate. Worth the money go for it. It looks durable will update after few months of usage.,Flip case quality is good but pen is useless,Good quality product receivedWith pencil with it The covers are sturdy, flexible and compelling. The back of the notebook has a nice texture to it as well.I would say that the quality of the pages is well above par and it does feel great when writing on it.It\\'s particularly helpful for students who take notes of separate subject\\'s lectures on the same copy and they are eventually scrambled up if not maintained properly. It\\'s also beneficial to students who create notes mostly using charts, tables, diagrams and the like as there\\'s division after 24 pages and you can\\'t write as much in depth. Definitely good still!,The books are in great condition and worth the price. Only thing different is the cover, nothing else. Worth for 114rs which i paid 🙌🏻,Good notebook,Quality is good but its size is small compared to my normal notebooks  . Overall a decent product.,A very good quality book,,NOTEBOOK KI SIZE CHHOTI H , OR WITHOUT LINE KE PAGES H , MERE ACCORDING TO YE 8TH CLASS TK KE BACHCHO KE LIYE THIK HAI, It\\'s good, but they give 2 different shades of Green and both the colours are same , there is no difference in the shade of greens,,Good for making notes and writing key points. Helps as a highlighter but they don\\'t look same as the picture. They look silvery and not black actually.,Nice product .,Nice,Good smooth penThank Amazon,Not bad,Useful pens Same type is available in half prize other make on Amazon,Cable is good and well built. it supports all sort of charging protocols. But Samsung galaxy s8 ultra seems to have some issues. It falls back to slower charging after a second or two of ultra fast charging when plugged in. It works fine with other devices just fine.,Quality of yhe cable is good. My cable is not working after 8 months. Duracell team is very responsive. They replaced the item immediately. Service is good. But only one problem is thickness of the pin must be improved.,The product is upto my expectations, worth the price, braiding is really good, i may not have the need to buy another cable again,Worth buying this cable, very durable,Its very tough material and very much durable too.,Super fast charging...long lasting due to sturdiness & strong build quality...absolute value for money product...plus 2yrs warranty...Sometime bit difficult to fold the cable due to its sturdy build but its OK looking at its edge...just go for it....a real value for money.,Very sturdy but over priced Using it and satisfactory.,Working good also not so expensive,Using this for an audio transition from Yamaha mgxu20 sound mixer to the laptop for live purpose excellent quality.,Bought it before one and a half month.... Works well.. Satisfied...🙂,Good quality, and cheap price,Great for the price works with my usb mic fantastically well. Just I find the usb b side is a bit loose when compared to my original OEM cables.. I have ordered several pairs but all are same. At least for my mic. But it’s not too loose to be called unusable,Works with my Casio ct-x700 well, It\\'s a good bluetooth mouse. Connects within 1 second. Battery is superb, after an almost 2 months of use it\\'s still at 100 percent. Lil pricey, more sleek, if it\\'s in your budget or around it, just grab it.No it\\'s not for gaming!,It\\'s small ergonomic mice , I just used it for lightwork purpose . But silent and fine feeling while clicking.,If you want a compact , small size, efficient, good looking mouse you can buy this. But a little over priced one.,It’s a nice product for the price.It’s very small so it’s very easy to carry around .But than can also be slight problem if you have big hand , not a deal breaker though,My sister said it looks a little old, the colour looks a bit…oldBut I like it,Like: No click sound, Ergonomic are good.Dislike: Should have light, Switching between Bluetooth to usb is backside of mouse this should be moved to side with a button,Easy to use, bluetooth works well with both mac and windows.,This mouse feels so good in hand , It\\'s the best that goes with a mac environment , It helps me get rid of my wired setup and connect to my windows and mac device at the same time in just one click Value of Money ...,Amazing apsara changed my son is left handed it changed his handwriting good but space pencil is litte ok,Ok,Value for money.,Nice pencil,It is ok,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QfDO96QaL._SY88.jpg,One of the best option to save money. I love zebronics company the quality is really good,I almost use it for 1.5 year .Pros :)1) Light weight.2) long enough cable length.3) price justify quality.Cons :(1) middle button is not smooth.2) not heavy duty, I mean not for gaming.As I did, now looking for new mouse.😥Conclusion: => good for light use like web browsers,  coding,  etc.Warning ⚠️ => not for gaming.,You can buy this Rs 99 + shipping charge from flipkart,It\\'s a good light weight mouse, you can easily carry in bags because of small design and looks good.You can also do decent gaming with this mouse.Great mouse at this price,Good,This price this good zebronics product,Worth for money,Works good It\\'s really good but it has alot of weight to it but after a week or so u will get used to it and the mouse requires an mouse pad because it\\'s heavy. You can find an good mouse pad for 100rs in amazon. It\\'s an really good mouse i suggest u take it but it will take u a week or so to get used to it and I actually love GM100 it\\'s easy to hold and it feels good the main thing I like is the click it sounds wonderful and it works good enough for gaming I mean I came to this mouse from an Dell office mouse . I hope this review helped u. You can buy this but keep this is mind that it has alot of weight to it but u will get used to it in a week or so,Nice mouse, good cable quality, WoW coupon also present.Only thing I didn\\'t like is that the primary buttons, which have a different finish, they are fingerprint magnets and don\\'t look really good.,Mouse is perfect at it\\'s price point and the build quality is also good I would recommend to buy it.... But i would like to rate 3 star for the packaging because there was no packaging..it came with a sealed box..,It is worth buying. Smooth and noilseless clicks,Don\\'t buy this mouse if u r planning to play compi fps games (valorant, csgo etc.),What I mean is if there\\'s is a game which involves accurate and precise gameplay thn Don\\'t buy this.This looks cool but that\\'s all.the sensor of this mouse is like those of 100-200 rupees mouse 😑😑instead go for Asus M3 if you are planning for a budget friendly and good sensor or else, G502 THE BEST,A really good product for ₹799 and the specifications are superb as mentioned and good inhand feel,Only problem is overweight,This mouse is perfectly doing well. The braided cable, the dpi switch, the LED effects, the control over the hand is perfectly build. And all that in just Rs. 650. I researched a lot but at this price range it\\'s the best. Charging power is very less. It takes hours to charge even a single phone.,Ok type product. Not very sturdy,Although it is written fast charging. However it charges quite slow compared to original chargers, even when one mobile is charged at one time.,When using a regular cable, it takes about 2 hrs for a full charge. When using this cable to the same socket and charger, it showing 10 hrs.,IPhone charger last for two months only,Charging not fast,Slow charging4500amh battery18 watt Charger4 khant full charge,Slow charging speed Everything is fine but it\\'s bit dark and stickey.It\\'s good.,Didn\\'t verified for water resistant 😜.

Pen is good,Good pen  but too pricy Good for gaming only. Other than that the sound quality is not as good as other models.(I have used 181, and still prefer that over 191).Battery back up is definitely better, but the case depletes fast due to the LEDs being lit everytime you put the pods back in.Ear pods are a bit bigger in size, so preferably not for those who use smaller earphones.,Don\\'t buy this item. Sound quality of this earbuds make my ears bleed. It gives a certain static sound when it\\'s silent. Only flashy thing is its got LED. Other than that at this price point you can get others. Don\\'t go for it. Genuinely.,Ear fittting depends;was cousing pain at first,the sound quality okay, noice cancellation need to be improved!,,One side is not working,This is good for those who wants bigger buds and ..it\\'s size is bigger than the normal so it may fall out form your ears and .. mainly it got automatically switched off..don\\'t know why,Good... But after few time ear starts paining.. very much,Sound quality and build quality is good 2022 its a best choise A peculiar product in the market. Good sound quality and build quality for this price range. The wood color and texture will not be the same as in the picture. writing this review after using it for more than a month. No problems yet. So, good budget wired headphone.,This product is very good for calling purpose no doubt about that. Made of woods definitely! Looks pretty I love the design and the logo. Sound quality if you are a music lover and would like to spend a little more then I would recommend SONY, Realme, Boat. But not this, this sounds like toad! I am very disappointed about the music quality for this.,Product is good in terms of sound, voice clarity.Mid bass for music. Value for money .recommended. .will try to post a review 6 months post usage.,There\\'s no bass but a flat sound while listening to music.I also struggle keeping those earbuds fixed in my ears, they are huge.It is durable however, suitable if one needs to use it for calling purposes only.,Dislike,Great look and light weight,Quality and sound is good.I was using this for past four months.

Via replacing the DVD driver. Go for it.,Its a overall good product with decent quality,Upgrade to ssd,I\\'ve been wanting to upgrade to an SSD for a long time. If I had gone to a shop, their charges would have been very high, so I thought of installing the ssd myself. Now I needed a hard drive caddy which I got here for a low price. And the good thing about it is that it is very easy to install. Only one thing was missing, there was no place to put the screw. it didn\\'t bother me. Maybe my laptop is too old, it would not be needed in the new one. See picture no. in 4.Everything is great low price and super easy to install.,Easy to use and work very well...,The package includes caddy, screws, and small screw driver for which i was really concerned cause some of them dont give it inside the packageBuilt quality is good worth buying,Build quality was good, all the accessories were provided in the pack itself. The write speeds are plateauing around 18 MBps and not 140 Mbps. That is a very huge gap. In which universe have they tested it. It is just okay; I\\'m disappointed by its performence.,This card offer 200 mbps but it can be achieve only with scandisk card reader other with other card reader it will be near 100-130 mbps read speed..,Overall product good but 1/4\" screw is only one.,Good quality at this price range,Exactly fits for canon 600D,Storage capacity is good. Speed seems fine. Good value for money.,The product is good and fast enough for data transfer of images from camera. However the pricing is not friendly it should be lesser compared to Extreme Pro,I was using Sandisk Ultra 32 GB, bgt this card for speed, but I didn\\'t see any difference in both the cards. No use upgrading card from Ultra series card. The card is good and one can go with Ultra series card dor similar performance at lower cost. Bought it for 2299! If you wanted to have a apple look like watch than here you have fire boltt ring pro No doubt! But if youre looking for actually worth watch for features and accuracy so go with another one! Battery is almost 4-5 days without calling! Inshort go with this only if you wanna showoff or good looking watch else its okay okay!,Battery life is decent , lasts upto 4 days with normal use,Battery is very fast drain but other features is good,Overall performance is good,Nice watch usefull product,Using for call purpose,Good one for the budget,Good under 2500 It’s a must have, easy to use , nice look. Easy to handle. The Bluetooth just connect seamless.I loved it,its silent than usual mouse but not fully silent. overall good,Good product,great product,To be honest this is the perfect mouse for office, its comfortable once you get used to it. The dongle free connection is the best part.,very sleek design, smooth working, easy to hold, noiseless.,Works with 2 systems. Connectivity is good. Control dpi with one click,Excellent product, very easy to use and carry around. Great quality overall in this price range.Bass is very low but not so low that it will feel bad.More of a balanced sound.If you use any app to improve audio such as wavelet it will almost feel like premium quality.Some points to to note:Mic is available in both the buds but will work in only 1 bud at a time. Whichever bud you will pull from the box that only will work.But if you use only 1 bud then any one of it will work  because any one of them can be used as master.You can use only one (any one of them) at a time and you can use it\\'s mic for call, touch controls to receive or cut calls. Or else play/pause music.But this dynamic use of mic have some bug. Sometimes this change won\\'t happens properly and mic will not work or the other bud which is inside box may have active mic started so the person you are talking to will complain about voice is not coming. Or some time may be muffled audio.Put both buds inside box and then take out again to reset it and it will work again properly.1 time I faced error that even after putting both buds inside didn\\'t make them off and they continued connected to mobile.I connected box to charger and the issue resolved.You can put 1 bud inside ear and other hold in hand and keep close to mouth to get superior mic quality even in streets where a lot of noise is or in the office where you need to speak in very low voice.Battery backup is almost same as claimed. You can watch movies, call for ling period and listen to song whole day without the need to charge the box.If you put buds inside box inbetween for few minutes then you can really use it for a day or 2 easily.,Overall the pods are good .I don\\'t know this piece is damaged or my system is lagging, sound delay happens at any random.But this sounds good , good product.Worth it ✨,Product giod for music or vedio but bad for calling,not good as expected,, after few days,left side earbud not working..,looking good but not working good....,I have had Boult\\'s wired earphones before and I loved them. But this is just way off the mark. The case is flimsy. It may look sturdy but it is light as a feather.The earphones themselves don\\'t connect unless you take them out of the case. And even when they do, there is pretty loud voice announcing it. For someone like me who doesn\\'t put the volume up too high, that voice is really irritating.Also I have noticed that the audio cuts out sometimes. I have no idea whether that\\'s a connectivity issue or something else.In conclusion, just go for something else. This was a bad one by Boult.,Nice product 👍,I am not sure what to say! It\\'s good for music but not useful for use for calls extremely non useful if you will speak anything the person other side  hear anything, Pro- Looks good- sectional copy- decent designs- round edgesCons- Pages are a little thin but you will find them of decent quality.- the total number of sheets is 150-5(color pages in between)= 145 sheets, 24 sheets in each section.. i.e. total of 290 pages.-You can\\'t choose the design,Quality was awesome but the appearance is not same.,The notebook is super ,But if you oder this then you might get the same as picture or different.Their are two types you might get1 plastic binding spiral2 metallic binding spiralMy option take metallic bind it is best and if you got plastic bind then you can replace it.,Paper is really smooth. Bought 26 of them each @100Great deal!,Like,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71NmxJM0XXL._SY88.jpg,Nice book with premium quality pages,Very nice Easy to use,It\\'s good and useful,Had been using this for quite sometime.

Now there are options to buy two separate devices but this solves my purpose and it doesn\\'t sticks out as well.It\\'s having Dual WiFi but I will suggest you to use on 5GHz as the 2.4GHz is a bit slow, slower then the regular 2.4GHz.,It\\'s a good device, good strength, plug and play so no installation needed,BUT got a defective device first which malfunction immediately on plugging, Replaced it with a new one and it\\'s been working well.,Using it for a couple of months now.

Although they have provided a paper for instructions with images on how to set it up - it\\'s very difficult for a new person to understand and then install it. A video link might help or you need to search on youtube. Print quality wise also - it\\'s not the best, but not worst also - it\\'s 4.8/5. I feel it\\'s a bit overpriced as well.I connected to my Windows 10 laptop, it asked me to download HP software from Microsoft Windows Store and a few next-next-next things, setup was quick.

Print quality is super,I\\'m using with mobile for printing only, and also easy to use Xerox. But some times at printing getting error & stopped printing trouble. And getting print was slow. Best budget product. Very good connectivity,Update to my below review. Issue was MAC authentication, for anyone with pppoe broad band connection make a note of ur existing routers mac address (go in the settings and see not the mac address on the sticker) and use it while setting up this otherwise reach out to your ISP they can update your new mac address.Not sure what is going on, but PPPoE broadband connection is failing. I already have an iBall router which works just fine but had some wifi issues hence I bought this. So set this one as an access point from my iBall router wifi is decent gets around 30-40 Mbps on my 100Mbps connection.,As of now it is working fine. The product is quite cost effective,RJ45 CABEL IS MISSING.,Good,Gives less speed compared to others, less range, good quality...,No problem till now , as of now I’m using it almost more than a year,Wireless range is not too much good There are folds when I have received the product. I am writing this review after using it for 2.5 months. It\\'s working fine. There is no wear and tear as of now. As per look it looks good on my black table.

However if you are in dark environment the video will have grain texture which is justified since at this price it should be expected but its fixable if you can adjust the ISO and get a good lighting. (Tube lights doesn\\'t work good enough and since I got direct source of sunlight , the day light gives me enough to have a good quality),The range of the screen is very wideGives a clear image I USE PARKER INK FOR CALLIGRAPHY AND IT IS WORKING GOOD BUT PRICE LITTLE BIT HIGH,The best thing is you can use it for any pen you want.

I\\'m loving the experience!,Received Black quink in bottle without plastic cover at bottle neck Let me start with something no one writes about.UI:Power On. Hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a Japanese/Indian woman\\'s voice, \"power On, battery about 70%\". She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones. Her voice volume level is not very high either.BT pairing:Turn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. The headsets voice will say, Bluetooth pairing\". Once connected, it will say, \"Bluetooth connected\". If BT disconnects, the voice says, \"Bluetooth disconnected\".Next track:Press and hold the + button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute \"chime\" and load the next song in the playlist of any app. I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. However, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. Buttons aren\\'t very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.Power off: just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.Volume up/down: No audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.Status LED:Blue: when On and slow blinking when connected to bt. When in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.Orange: while charging. Solid on.Green/off: 90% and above.Physical clues: tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. Only reputed brands have it.Same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume +.Coloured Dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.Ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. Most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. These don\\'t. I use the smallest one.What does Sony offer?A very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. I\\'ve never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. Once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.Audio App. It\\'s basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. It plays MP3 from your storage too. My phone already has a built in Equalizer. I don\\'t use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. So all types of audio sounds great.FAQIs it flimsy?No, but feels like you might damage it if you\\'re not careful.Does it really last 25hr?Yes, I\\'ve tested it sort of. And never managed to run out of battery.How much did you spend on it?1.6kAudio lag?None. I tested it with Android TV, LG web os, Android phone, ps4 and iPad. No issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.Bass?Very decent and controlled.Vocals?Very clearTreble?Sharp and crisp.Loudness?You can listen at full volume without much discomfort. But I\\'d suggest not to.I compared it with JBL wave tws100. The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.80% Better than boat airdopes.30% better than OnePlus bulletsZ.,After using it for a week i returned it,here\\'s my understanding,Pros,1.Music Quality: mids and highs are well defined, if u want u can add bass from EQ ,that also provides bass with quality not boomy and unsubtle2. Fast Pairing : pairs instantly3. Hardware Level EQ : u can tweek it to your own desire4. Good Mic QualityCons:1. NO MULTI PAIR SUPPORT.. i.e u can\\'t switch between ur lap and mobile instantly or in standby2. Cable Quality : The Provided Cable are so thin and fragile, causes me to restrict my movements on wearing3. No Magnetic Tips for AUTO PLAY/PAUSE.. If wear it to sleep, it can\\'t be turned off by simply removing and sticking it together like other neackbands , u have to use or phone or the buttons to pause the music.Conclusion: I returned it and bought realme neackband 2 though it was horrible boosted bass and mediocre sound Quality, simply because of better features, but i still prefer the SONY on music quality.,Grip to the ear need to improve,Good,The product is well packed and tamper proof packed with Sony hologram in the box.Cons-This is compatible with new edge Bluetooth version 5.0 so might not work with old phones like in my case with Sony R1 plus and xperia M.Works with Redmi 10 pro.in my case.This is not exactly band but LR connected with thik wire which might fall if jumping or during workout.Sound is 10% lower to Sony wired headphones.Pros-Clear and balance sound with Sony quality music hearing experience.Base feels sufficient and clear .not like uncomfortable.The connecting wire instead of hard plastic band makes it light flexible and weightless to wear and packing in the luggage.Mic clearity is 100% pure and your voice is very clear and sharp to the front person,not like others.It\\'s complete value for money as this is perfect in its quality which many brands in this price tag is not able to do.This can be folded and packed in 4\".Conclusion -Go for it if you are riding and puting this inside ur collar not open, else it will fly. Not suggested for gym as it will fall.Function are smart and easy to useSimply it gives you the best quality at this price and connectivity with mobile is strong too.Not for Magic expecters ....YouTube & Insta - the_voyager_ad,Sound quality is good.,Battery life is great with good sound quality.Audio quality of phone call is poor. Keep this in mind if you are using this product more for calling.,Quality of the product and its sound is good.But it always slips from the neck..There is nothing to hold it in place.Keeps falling and i am afraid i might lose it. It is working as expected so farNo complaints,Godod,The product is definitely worth the price and keeps the laptop super cool. I am not a gamer and this review is NOT for a gaming PC. Its very convenient for my office work. The cooling pad has an additional usb and it helps in case an additional usb port is required when using the cooling pad.,not in mostly use,Good product..but fan speed is little slow,I tried it on my gaming and office laptop.There was 0 difference in temperatures on gaming laptop.Office laptop (14\" HP core i5 8th gen) did feel slightly cool to touch) with the cooling pad but its ergonomics aren\\'t greatBut its Value for Money. The two fans offer very little airflow and audible noise, in winters!Body is sturdy enough but the laptop slips from the top grillAnd when you use the non slip clips on the front, they come in the way of your hands, while working on the laptop.Your hand essentially rests on those clips and it hurtsDesign needs improvement and fans should have higher airflow. Accordingly, a customer wouldn\\'t mind slightly higher price,It is a decent product and economic in this price range.Fan speed is decent, for better speed give power from your charger.Not recommended for high end performance laptops.,A good product that keeps that decreases  the laptop heat. My dell vostro 3510 with 11th gen i3 would hover at around 60 - 65 c during regular use such as browsing, movies , youtube , ps1 emulation etc. but with this cooler the temps came down to 40 - 55 c . During heavy gaming ( tested with fallout new vegas CPU 40 - 50 % iGpu 99%) the laptop heated up as if there was no cooling pad but the laptop surface felt cooler . Please note that I live in a hill station and the climate is generally cool so your experience may be different. I have not tested this with a gaming laptop . good quality tool from d linkWiFi signal is good,Nice product,Overall good and a better experience,It funcions properly and useful to me.,I you want to buy it for CP Plus Orange DVR, it works.,Nice,Its not plug an play u need to install the driver and will support till 2.4 Ghz not above that. Im using in Jio wifi so its not supporting 5G connectivity as its 3.0,The first reason I bought this item was to have a surveillance camera in my house. To view it on my mobile Used,etc.... Good Product, saves your palm from the rough surfaces. It\\'s ok so far. The external material deteriorated a little, but nothing like it has become unuable or something. Other than that all good.,I am super satisfied with this mouse pad. I have been using this for office work as well as gaming for the past few months and I have to say it provides extraordinary comfort. Definitely will recommend everyone to go for this as it exceeded my expectation.,Ggreat mouse pad. 2 month using after post review,Using this product since 9 months. Soft and really useful for daily use. Bought it for 425/- bucks. I will Recommend buying this product.,It is a wonderful product and gives the best experience and reasonable price. Build quality and smoothness is excellent. It totally gives a premium in-hand feel.Would definitely recommend it.,Absolutely terrific purchase. Worth the price. It\\'s very sturdy at the bottom so it doesn\\'t move when you use the mouse and the the grip is also great.I purchase this after my hand got scratched because of the table where I keep my hand when using the mouse. Now the problem is resolved.,value of money,Different colour should be available Well I had a notion that cheap bt headphones could not produce good sound.. Well I was wrong.. N Im glad .. I use iem, in ear wired headphones usually.. Used sony skullcandy soundmagic kz.. M not gonna say its better then all of the above but u will be satisfied with the product.. Sound quality is awesome.. Bass is good not like in ear..but still wonderful and enough .. U cant have the effect of an in ear earphones bass quality in a cheap bt.. For that u need to spend at least 10k I think.. It has a passive sound isolation.. Nd its great.. Due to its fit and the foam half of the outer noise gets substacted just by putting it on.. Then the rest go out while the music is on.. Dual mode is good.. But don\\'t think anyone would use the normal mode.. Cant use the phone eq on nt headphones thats a down side.. But u can use other third party eq or the eq in Spotify or saavn works.. The headphones itself might feel it could break cos all of it is made of plastic.. But feels like its a good one... And wont break .. The pads are soft it dosent hurt the head or the ear.. Used it for hours.. Been hearing from a lot of review about the sound quality of these.. But believe me most of them r giving the review after using it for the first time.. Headphone guide 101 u need to burn the drivers I mean u need to use the headphones for a couple of days to get its full potential.. And sound quality is very good.. Vocals are easyly separated bass is enough.. Treble is the right amount (the way I like it) sound stage is good due to being a on ear with big dynamic driver.. And u would feel the richness of the sound cos of the brand.. A better headphone is the one which creates good and detailed sound.. Not those who are loud.. So yeah I would recommend this over boat. And one last thing.. Due to it being only a bt headphone and no aux cable is available.. The sound quality deepeneds on the device ur using the Bluetooth quality and the amount of sound out put it can produce.. U can charge it with ur nrml charger if its 5v .. Do not use fast charger.. Been using it for two days now.. Need to burn them drivers more.. And will update on the sound quality.. And yeah the battery back up is really good have used it for almost 4/5 hours still 70% charge left.. It shows in the bt connectivity sec on ur phone.. At the end if ur looking for a headphone with a good premium look a well reputed brand and great sound quality do buy this without a doubt.. This r satisfactory very much.. Go for it.P. S Amazon delivery is really not up to the mark.. Even being a reputed company and all ow and another thing saw some complain about it being manufactured in china mine says manufactured in Malaysia.. Yes its a original one have registered it with harman audio..,Everything, the bass, the battery ..is superb 👌🏻Just a big and only problem, it doesn\\'t support dual Connectivity 🙁 (which is available in even Boat\\'s below ₹1000 headphones)Dual Connectivity is very much required for many, as we have to work together on smartphone & laptop simultaneously.so, again & again disconnecting from lapy the connecting to mobile is just pain.😢So, Harman please include dual Connectivity.Bought this at 12.5k,Good one, but sound is low. Who wants to listen music veru loud with high bass it\\'s not for them. Also it\\'s not covering for me sometimes it\\'s giving pain while using long hours.,good,Good product,Good quality,agar build quility ko chhor diya jay to to yah headphone 2100 tak k best headphone h,ok Very thin and sleek,Premium quality Over all good,Waluable product for a student.,Worth for the moneySuitable for hard use,It\\'s been a week since I got this and so far it\\'s good.. does the job !,I really am enjoying using my ipad even more. Really worth it. Colour is also very good. You can definitely go for it.,Overall the product quality is good.FYI : If you are looking for an iPad cover with pencil holder this may not be the best option., ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon’s own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn’t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn\\'t also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it\\'s mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one. - excellent piece of wireless mouse- reasonable price and worth every penny- one problem i faced is the scroll stopped working now,Performance is good and very silent 🐭🐭🐭,Good mouse....cursor movement is good....click is literally noiseless....size could have been a little big...overall good,It\\'s a good one.Like : Very soft to hand. No clicking sound. Very favorable for IT Guys who wants quiet environment.For size of the Mouse, Neither too small nor very big in hand.Dislike: You can consider it very less. As it is a very soft to hand, care in uses must be taken.,Good.,I got this mouse because sometimes it is easy and conserves space. Also, I wanted to be a bit away from my laptop screen. Please note, that it is best if you buy even a wireless keyboard, then you are truly away. I bought this for 1200.,This is a very good wireless mouse, works seamlessly, fits superb on your hand and is simple plug and play. The grip on the hand is amazing, and the size is just right for everything from simple browsing to playing the game. Mouse is sensitive on any surface and doesn\\'t require a pad, i use it on the bed without any issue. Just go for it.,giving five stars so that you could notice it https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715D5RP3RIL._SY88.jpg,They r super  good..Love them,Nice,Nice.,Good product,Bahut acche lagte Hain,My daughter liked these acrylic paint tunes.

This thickness can cope with the windows\\xa0laptops as they are having\\xa0the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen.\\xa0This spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid\\xa0will not harm the screen, screen frame, and laptop lower-up body. But, still, don\\'t put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers, than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself. The sliding function is very smooth, but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage.The device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids.Now, for the \"Mac Laptop \\'\\' users, it is not a product for your\\xa0laptop, and never try this product for your Mac laptops. As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers, that is there\\'s no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this\\xa0product will damage (crack/break) the plain glass screen.Installation is easy, remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker, using the scale for support, or else you could stick it a little inclined. After sticking, rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra-light pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes. And there you go for your satisfied invisible life.*Important - Even if not in use, slide it 2-5 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust.Overall, it is a good product. For me, it has worked awesome. Green Signal from here.Thank You :)SUGGESTIONSTo the Manufacturer - Notice the static frame of the webcam\\xa0cover, and make its edges (the edges close to the slider) smooth (rounding off or fillet), so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easily\\xa0slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.To the Seller - Well packagingTo the Consumer - Check for the rubber spacers/buffers provided in the laptop (like Windows laptops), if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not (like Mac laptops), it\\'s not the product for you. Even for Windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. Slide it 2-5 times once a week to avoid jamming.DISCLAIMERThe review(s) and rating(s) has(ve) been made upon personal usage(s) / experiment(s) / experience(s) / perspective(s) for specific product(s) acquired / delivered.,I usually don\\'t trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try. It was delivered within 3 days after placing the order. I received it on 12th June. First impressions were really good. I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but It\\'s been 3.5 months and there\\'s not even a single crack in my screen.𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝟰.𝟱/𝟱You will get 3 webcams covers in the package. It\\'s extremely thin. So, It won\\'t cause any issues when you close the laptop(Hp pavilion gaming used here) but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air, Asus TUF, Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. At the end it\\'s your choice.𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟯/𝟱I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak. It literally falls off after a week of applying it. I had to throw 2 of it as it became useless. I only had the last piece remaining.𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 : Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem.• Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol.• Then apply a strong Adhesive glue (I used Fevi Kwick). Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover. Since it\\'s extremely thin, I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue  will spill out and make a mess.• Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. And then you\\'re good to go.Its been 3 months after using the Super Glue technique. Forget about about falling, It has not even moved a bit. No effect on the quality of my webcam. The cover won\\'t interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. And fully covers it when you want privacy. Overall, Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,Good product,I wish I had known this before ordering. Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied it.Apple urges people not to close their MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook!!! It may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.MacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. This item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!If you are going to use it on your MacBook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. You can use it without worry on iMac as it\\'s a desktop and doesn\\'t get closed. You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn\\'t embedded inside the glass screen. If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.For disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options. One is you trust Apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. According to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.If you\\'re not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don\\'t see how there could be an issue.Why am I still giving this product 3 stars? It reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. It\\'s not a bad product. They just need to stop advertising it for MacBooks! Quite affordable but got a few issues-just got one usb connector that connects both mouse and keyboard. What if someone wanted to use them separately-Mouse sleeps after a long time and you have to press a key in keyboard inorder to make the mouse active again,Amazing i Really really  like it, this keyboard or mouse using daily feel good and more  interest at work to do,I bought this for daily use for my 2 devices but since has only one receptor so it can only be used with either KVM or single machine at once.Also the battery hole on the keyboard will only accomodate \"LR06 AA\" batteries only and is not even suitable for the normal AA batteries so you will have to have 2 differnet kind of batteries for both the mouse and the keyboard.Also, there is always a lag in the typing of the keyboard its not as efficient, like if i press 2 keys pretty quickly one after the other so either it will pick only one key stroke or the second key stroke before the first one.Yes this combo is pretty good if you are going to have a normal usage at home with just one PC in place then it is one of the most worth the money products but for all rest and regurous usage this will not satisfy the needs and you would need to go higher ranges of combo.,Pros:Built quality.Design.mouse design and accuracy.Cons:Seems small keyboard, no num pad. same as apple keyboard size.if your budget under1500, go for it.,Smooth key press,There should be a switch button,Device is very good, suitable for travelers,I like the size of the product and operation.Easy to fit in the laptop bag evenCarry for presentations outside to operate from a distance I want laptop size stand,Good product,Hi, I brought this product since a colleague also used same product, I got to know that this is worth the product buy from this vendor.I saw it is more than worth it and performs as shown in product images and description.I can feel I can work for long hours with my laptop with this stand.After buying this product felt I made a good choice with seller also. Product quality is awesome I am writing this after using the product for more than a month,Easy to use and carry,Easy to use, light weight and multi functional.,This is a great product, I am using for my laptop as a stand. This helps me to adjust screen angle easily.,Light on weight and good flexibility,It\\'s save space and easy to handle It’s a good product in this price, I would hardly get any worst thing about the product as far I am using this it’s totally fine. Battery life is good, case is good, looks is good, and the sound is great. This range this product is good. If you are thinking about other companies than that’s also fine. First compare than buy,You will enjoy the music for sure. It\\'s loud with decent bass. But if you are picking this up for calls, it\\'s ok when you are in silent sapce. It\\'s definitely not a good option if you have to use them for calls during a ride or in a noisy public places.,Not good for callig,Good for music,You get what you pay for..Does the job.. the button is very sensetive, so even when you when to press them to go back right into your ears , something or the other gets happens... May be it\\'s too early for me to get use to it... Over all alright product for the price. Bluetooth connectivity good.,Too small need to be careful if ur moving around..Well only time will answer if it\\'s worth the price,Does not fit in ear..Always falls..Rest is ok, WD only names ENJOYED PRODUCT,good,Speed is as it shows on package.Good one.Should be baught,Product was good, but delivery people behaviour was in RUDE and Reckless Manner. They simply throwing the packages. Even though I object that way of doing, they irrecklessly giving answers like \" we r throwing packages as it is, tell to anybody whom you want\". Please cancel the licences of of Amazon  delivery agency.,Hi, I write this review after a long working period without any trouble in SDD , compare with HDD this SDD have boot my laptop much faster than old HDD, and R/WR speed is good , trust to buy with more capacity in feature ,Thanks for the good product,I was looking for 2nd HDD for backup SSD purpose, it\\'s not high-speed IO disk, but getting all the advantages of SSD along with name of WD.,best product,I personally recommend using the product. superb fast.,Verry usefull for boosting speed of pc Impression of the pen were good... Handling grip is also ok. Can be recommended to buy,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/61IjZfKMffL._SY88.jpg,Worth for money. Excellent performance.,It will stop writing in between eventually and has smooth area at first when writing after some time the grip will be comfortable.,Received only 21 pens 4 pens are missing although pens r very gud it gives a smooth writing and a stylish look as well….,Product is nice and it works smoothly but I didn\\'t get the refils. Otherwise it is very nice,Reasonably okay,Why only 20 pens?It said there are 25 pens I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren\\'t available and the replacement B43 drivers don\\'t allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for \"morrownr/8821au-20210708\" and use the driver on Github. I\\'m using the product \"TP-Link AC600\" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don’t support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product. Nice combination for color sketches,It glides great but is sometimes not..,Smells bad when you open it,Cap grip not good,All good just the little messed up,Gel ink is good, but the cap isn\\'t tight enough, keeps coming off,I literally like the flow which is smooth like butter. Plus this also contain golden and silver shades 👍,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71J4WF7wTSL._SY88.jpg Single touch on off is very bad every time use  and single touch any surface this pen  is off please update,Works great, only issue is, it turn off suddenly after 10-15 mins of use. Also, Power on and off sensor is very sensitive. But oher than this issue, works as it should,Charging is not so longer,Pretty decent for money,Good product at reasonable price,,perfect fit for AMAZON BASICS (Pencil), really awesome, beyond my expectations!!!,After few days of usage , Works fine you can see YouTube reviews for details one drawback is accidental touch on top tends to power off the device. The charging  C cable within the pack I got is defective doesn’t plug in correctly. Charge holds for good time over a day’s usage Kingone is cheaper in AGIF Sale and this one was relatively expensive but at price point compared to apple this is good for casual use. This turned out to be the worst mouse ever! Double clicking within a month and scroll wheel scrolling in the reverse direction randomly.Edit 1The warranty requires you to take the mouse to their service centre which was a pain as it took me a while to find the nearest service centre and the address was incorrect. The service centre was helpful though as they replaced my mouse in a matter of minutes with no hassle. Will edit based on how the replacement works.Edit 2Replacement mouse working well so far.,This mouse feels and looks awesome, the slight rubbery texture feels premium and the build quality is also amazing, but the clicks seems to be a little sensitive. For regular use it’s amazing. Can’t get better but for gaming, i would want a mouse with a little sturdier click, i click heavy during gaming and the mouse may take it but it remains in my head. So even for light gaming it’s fine where use of click is less as compared to fps shooting games.,It is an awesome upgrade for beginner level gamers, just changing mouse can actually improve your experience and gameplay. My boyfriend recommended this to me as we play Valorant together and my aim was persistently bad even though i tried so hard playing with regular Bluetooth dell mouse, changing from that to this piece was a great doing, 100% recommended if you\\'re just starting to play anything like CSGO/Valorant or any other first person shooter game on regular basis.,i purchased it on16dec and i am writing this on 19dec and i\\'ll be honest no other mouse can offer this much quality in this price so if you can buy it just go ahead but but there\\'s an alternative mouse by razer almost the same price razer deat ader i guess that\\'s the name so you better check that one if rgb is not your priority yiu can choose that one bye....,Go for it,Design is easy to hold and there are extra buttons on right side which I find very useful. Its  size is perfect for my hand . Just one bad thing is after using for some time its surface become smoother or upper layer gets removed,Good mouse but Has poor wire quality,It’s little big but the mouse is giving it’s best for gaming It cost should be under Rs. 500,Buy it,Color is as per the photo but takes longer to charge. Also doesn’t charge on all sockets.Seems to work better when plugged in directly in the laptop.,Length of the cable is long so that you can happily use it for long distance as week and quality is really good,1 meter pInk charging wire for iPhone X long and strong one for use..,I have been using this lighting cable for almost a month now and the cable turned out exactly as it was shown. I took the rose gold one that matches my phone’s color. Although the metal ends of the cable was rose gold, but the whole cable was pink, which I didn’t like. I went for the 2m long cable so that i can use it conveniently even if it is charging. Though it’s kinda bulky, yet serves it’s purpose. Charging speed is fast and efficient just like the original cable had. Also quite durable and sturdy. My Apple’s original lighting cable had some problem while charging so I purchased this one after watching many YouTube videos and reviews. It was indeed a good purchase.,It’s long and good,It’s a superb product in terms of sturdiness, looks, and charging speed. Onedra full prodact,Good but sometime sound doesn\\'t clear,Best Quality Bluetooth Speaker, With Great Bass and Sound Enhancement..Problems :1.Charging Cable is So Poor in Quality2.Charging Port Could Not Be Connected Easily Due to Loose Connection Of Ports Some Times A Little Shake will Dis-connect The Charger.3.Charge Percentage is Not Shown Anywhere.Other Than This Little Audio Lag issue when Video\\'s are played But it doesn\\'t Happen all Time.Advantages :Best Solid BodySound Quality is Lit🔥Best To Watch Movies With High Quality Audio.Thanks for This Best Product ZebronicsPlease Resolve This Little issues in This Product,Thank You.Edit (14 Dec 2022)Now I Have Problem Replacement is also not available in amazon app, Charging Port is Not Working Properly Every time Automatically Switch Off In Full Charge also. Please Replace My Order Zebronics.,,With 10W sound is Low.,Switches are on the sides hence it\\'s difficult to operate.. For mode same switch is there.. Sound quality is average .. Product is light weight..,Charging taking more time,Sound quality is spuer, bass effect is low but worth for this price. important : battery percentage not showing anywhere It works great for my laptop,This is a good accessory to connect SATA drives to Computer via  USB interface,The advantage is that there is no need to stop computer, attach drive to SATA then restart, format etc.This is faster to install without turning off the computer,.The con is that the DATA transfer speed is less. Also this cannot be used to boot from, so its just an accessory to transfer data to and from computer in easy way, BUT one cannot boot into this like one can using USB drive.,It is very handy, speed is awesome. Working flawlessly but the build quality is very delicate, they should improve the build quality. But the main job can be done without any problem and I\\'m getting upto 100 Mbps speed.,,The product is good for the use,not cheap but its ok price. Also Usb 3 so its fast. And the Quality of the material is not that bad its plastic but good plastic.,Amazon sent a replacement as the first delivered cable stopped functioning in one hour.The product works. It seems USB 3.0 compliant.BUT, it is VERY Flimsy For a product that could be used multiple times and will need to be connected and detached from a 2.5-inch HDD or SSD...The plastic housing for the SATA port can be squished, and it even bends and moves a little.The cable is a foot long, but is thin and needs to be thicker.I have another USB 3.0 to SATA port adapter but it is pretty sturdy.If you are going to keep the SATA part connected always, then this product could be OK, but NOT recommended for Professionals who rely on such a cable to connect multiple drives in a day.,Its working fine with old Seagate hard disk,Okay Product. Online price could be maximum 299, strictly in my opinion... Good for the price,Nice one,Just OK for the price...,BATTERY NOT WORKING,Comfortable and small to useIssue in power supply that melts the charger cable of smart watch,,Pasand,Sleek etc yes, but mine stopped working after 7 months.  It has a moulded outer casing ie no screws to open/repair if it stops working. Replace it in warranty else throw it away..Buy at your own risk.High time Indian consumers got #righttorepair Giving this review after using it for 2 months.I am using 3 more cameras from other brands which are China made. I bought them 4 or 5 years ago and there are various issues with them. Wanted to buy this Qubo camera and give it a try as this is Made in India and from the famous Hero Group. The product did live up to my expectation!!Here are my observations:Pros:- Excellent in performance.- Accurate in motion detection.- Can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet.- LED turns red when there is no internet connectivity.- Crystal clear vision even in night.Cons:- Had to struggle a bit in configuring it. The usability of the app is not easy to understand. Figured out the right options to use after few trials. Hence giving 4 star rating.- The LED doesn\\'t glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.Keep it up Hero Group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!,The Qubo 360 camera is great. I am able to set it up for my kittens whom I can be assured once I leave my house for some time. The best feature is the two way talk in which we can communicate via the camera itself.,Product is very easy to install as well as setup and use. It is excellent motion detection and also has person detection which is not available in this price range.,Camera quality and clarity are good. Also having excellent features. This camera was delivered on time and the tech support is also good. :)The only missing feature is that this camera lacks storage to external nvr.,I bought this model for my living room, it’s very decent and easy to install. Working very well.,It is I goo product I  using It and I hai be over 1 month and I have no issues with this product,Target has to fixed as it observed motion and went over there( on wall) it get stuck over there as no motion now next.,Great product. Works well, just faced couple of issues while setting up but after that it is working great. Very good,Why go for cheap Chinese ones.,Good cells,some of cell is not at 100% but they are at 90 or 80%PRICE IS low but stock is old. rest ok.,Got for just 110.. great,Good product I think but not great.I have replaced old cr2025 cell with this new one and all working good, but it is providing dim-light when pushed light button. So I think this Chota-power is not providing sufficient power.,For my daughter\\'s notepad, the perfect cell which I received with fast delivery at home.What else one can expect from Amazon!! :-),Good quality The best thing is we can use it in different ways.,Satisfied purchase. Price is lesser than in shops. Good one. Quality also is nice.,According to description. Satisfied,Excellent,I like this product\\'s quality. I will try to add more pictures when I finished my drafting if it looks good...,Very good to use,like it,Nice colour texture nice product,Very good adpeator.,My laptop is Ideapad 320 , i am looking for the company charger . The charger specifications I hot got are : AC adapter 65 W and model : ADLX65CCGI2A .It is a original charger and this is the exact charger which is same as my earlier original one . I am happy for this product . It is very good charger Worked fine . Charged 100 percent in 1.5 hours . let see how it will perform further . Any one looking for Idea pad 320 go for it , no doubt it will suits your laptop . Got it for 1400 rupees,This is the exact same charger I got with my Ideapad 320-15IKB and it works great. It\\'s a genuine product with all the related papers in the box. Quite a steal at 1.3K as the buying the same from Lenovo\\'s website costs more than double the price of this. Fast delivery too. Go for it!,I saw this product in service center for 2400 and here got on half price , using from last 2 months and working very good and a genuine product.,It\\'s Orginal Lenovo charger.. Should buy it,So far so good. Looks like original and I think they are selling original. Go for this one. Same as my original one. No poor feedback,It charges my laptop in 3 hours,  but my laptop battery is 4-5 years old . Battery life is low. Otherwise charger is working fine for me. Not a perfect fit for long usage,One problem you may face if you use it continuously for a long time may be ear ache can be start..,Although it\\'s an HP product there\\'s nothing to write home about this headphone. It does what it is promised and there\\'s value for money as you can trust the brand but don\\'t expect anything \\'extra\\'. No volume control or on/off button, comfortable to wear but not designed for comfort, clear sound, and a mic but no advanced features for either. Yet it\\'s good for the price!,Product would not meet my expectation and sound quality is poor.,Sound quality is good , cancels the background noise.,Not a bad deal,Build quality and sound quality was good,Base and noise cancelling is also good ☺️😊,I bought it in october month but now is not wprking properly Get it! Get it! Get it!It is my second time getting this keeb as I had modified (foam+tape mod) and sold my first one which I had brought from elitehubs I was going to get it again from them but they lost my account from their server T_T which I had a few cashbacks balance on.Pro\\'s: 1000hz polling rate! ( Confirmed and checked using USB Viewer by Microsoft)  Best RGB leds I\\'ve seen on a keyboard under 8K these things are bright & vibrant af  Great clicks especially for a linear switch  Decent enough build quality  Angled Usb C port at the side (life saver for  me) |  Feels great for typing and gaming  Looks great  Con\\'s: There aren\\'t any con\\'s if you get this keeb! but just to be Nit-picky  1. I would say that the switch and keycap puller that comes with this board is better if not used as the quality of it a bit on the lower side and it has a tendency to damage switches while pulling them out  2. The software is sweet and simple but some more features can be added.  That\\'s it, get it soon before the stock runs out :),Must have mechanical keyboard for your typing and gaming needs. The keys are hot swappable. No drivers needed just Plug and Play. Must Download the software if you want a specific RGB colour or transitions and macros. Excellent built quality. Swiftly delivered from Origin Shop in 4 days. Price is justifiable. For people using the UK layout keyboard, press Shift+END key for @, press \\\\| key above return key to type #. Use Fn+WASD keys for navigation. Cheers !,too small for my hands.I recommend the keys little more spaced and big for easy clickingThanks, for reading my review.,This is my first mechanical keyboard and I\\'m so happy with this. Apart from the lights, I like the sound the keys make, the quick response and swift keys. I\\'d recommend it for people who might want to switch to the mechanical keyboard.  Also, the grey and white colour is awesome!,,,The quality of the keyboard is goodThe sound n keys r impressiveThe main point is the RGB which is excellent with soo many RGB modes which is always controlled by the software and the brightness is the best.If u r looking for a red switches mechanical keyboard and you love rgb go for this one... But its 60% keyboard, if u r a coader or needs arrows key ig you should choose something else but if non of problems u have just go for it,Using it from last 4 monthGreat value for moneyGreat lightsThey provided extra switches also which was lifesaver for me (i changed 2 switches in kb cuz W key and backspace was broked)Easy to MoD quality is ok ok only,Well go for it good cable,Useful product in this price.,Very nice,Good,Charging speed supports up to 25V,Product quantity is excellent but very slow charging,Cable is absolutely good looking , strong , durable. But not support fast charging as I expected , I checked speed with stopwatch , I am using Realme phone , with my original realme 20w charger and original cable the time takes to charge 68% to 69% is 34 sec. But with this ambrane cable it takes 1 min 32 sec to charge from 69% to 70%.Little disappointed with charging Speed , overall product is goodHope this review help you guys ! I bought it 6 months ago for my hp inktank419.It\\'s working better than local ones.Colour quality is good like original.Colours not coming off from glossy photo paper.I don\\'t know about originality.,Good to receive original HP ink from Amazon. It was also delivered in record time.,Good for perfect printout,The ink is 20% missing. Otherwise it is a genuine product. Very good printing and no problem at all. However as I said it is filled only 80% or 75%,All buy original products to keep your product safe,Nice,The ink quality is very good, original product. I got perfectly packed bottles, all sealed. But, the ink bottles are 1/4 empty, though the bottles are big and of large diameter, so I guess it contains 135 ml ink.The mouth of the bottle is big and a 10 ml syringe easily gets inside. I used this ink to refill my canon PG47 cartridges. I am surprise with the print quality and count of prints. Same deep black color like the original PG47 cartridge.,Nearly 1/4 th of the bottle is empty I liked the watch, the battery of this watch is so good that before use i charged this watch and it\\'s been 2 weeks and this watch still have 25% battery left. And nagative side is i ordered black strap watch and i got grey strap watch and this is sellers mistake, i tried to return this and I\\'ve called Amazon help line then hear my problem and see it online that i got wrong item and then they say they will connect me to other person who will solve this and then no one pick the call the ring just continue to ring and after 5min i thought that no one is gonna pick the call ever and i disconnected and start using it. Watch have some basic futures and i like it.,One of the best product in this price range. Been using it for a year now and I have no complaints. Built quality is good. Steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands (Apple/Fossil). But I have seen worst. Touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected. This is water and swim resistant. I am not sure if it has IP67/8 rating but I believe this is dust proof as well, since I have been using it for almost a year now.Good product for this price range.,Everytime sleep mode has to activate, this should not be done. It should be automatically.,Good product,bezels are big but it\\'s ok for this price range and I am satisfied with the product.,Watch is beautiful and upto mark, only one con in this watch, you can\\'t  attend the call and revert you can only revert by messages,Nice,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZeE6pWAaL._SY88.jpg, Short review - Really good product and sound quality is very nice. Good for living rooms about 12x12 ft or even bigger space. I installed it and connected to TV using coaxial cable. Volume, clarity, bass, everything is perfect. Overall value for money product.Long review - I have experience other company speakers like JBL and Sony and had decided to buy those, but this one is similar in sound quality. Treble is nice and crisp. Vocals sound nice even at higher volumes. Bass is amazing - fills entire room with that BOOM sound. Watching movies and listening to music is much better now with these speakers.Used these for about 7 days and overall experience is good.-- Sound bar (not subwoofer) - Size is big considering this is 80W, but for me this is perfect size as it matches my TV length and looks good.-- Subwoofer - Small and compact unit. Bass is amazing. Gives that boom effect in action scenes and when listening to music.-- Remote - Minimal but functional remote. Has all the required features in single click.-- Connectivity - Does not have optical SPDIF but that\\'s ok as Coaxial option is available and mostly all TVs have Coax connectivity only. Take a look below for Bluetooth connectivity. Overall Bluetooth works very well, except when you connect certain devices with newer hardware.I have a smaller unit installed in another room and always used to watch movies on that speaker unit. But after listening to this one, I feel sound, and bass of that other unit is just very low. This one really sounds good and makes watching movies and listening to music a good experience.Note: I think the unit uses Bluetooth 4. If you have devices with new BT 5.0 drivers or hardware, when you connect such newer devices, treble and sound quality has minor issue. Not much but still you can hear it in some situations that treble, and vocals are not clear. This is not an issue when you use your mobile to connect using Bluetooth. I wanted crystal clear sound, so I have connected using coaxial cable and sound quality is amazing over wired connection.,Sound quality is average not up to the mark,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OBa98lVML._SY88.jpg,All the best but AUX mode not working,It would be good it the sound system was more better 😁,Best,Nice prodect,Remote playback so best mujhe to acha laga #tag zebronic The Sound quality is Great 👍🏻.. all the treble highs and mids are great but the bass is kinda okay Okay...,I have bought it two times. I like this. I have been using it since January 2021,Good quality earphones and bass,Yes bass is also best,It\\'s awesome,Like it,good,The sound is just like other boat eraphones I\\'ve tried, slightly bass heavy not as balanced as you\\'d expect from more expensive brands, most people would like it tho.Pastel blue/purple colour looks pretty good. 👌,1 bati , 5 bati,Voltage and performance is not at par with other brands.,Good quality batteries.,these cell are good replacement,These are original Duracell batteries. My car FOB key asks for a single CR2032 so instead I put two CR2016 one over other like a sandwich. Works like normal. But you don\\'t try this hack. I needed CR2016 for my FastTrack watch so I ordered them but tried the above hack for my car keys and it worked. Do not try this at home. Lol.Tip- when handling any kinda batteries make sure you don\\'t touch both - ve and +ve side at the same time. It discharges the battery sooner. Handle it with a plastic tweezer or with silicone gloves.,Best li-ion cells.For car keys , etc, I ordered this mi camera recieved the product but it was defective not working properly so i called customer care and placed the request for replacementThe replacement order was supposed to be delivered by 26 dec 2022But today is 3rd jan 2023 it is yet not delivered i am being told the package has been lost you return the defective product and you will get the refund.After waiting so long the product is not delivered and i will get the refund very bad service from Amazon,Night Vision is Good sometimes person detected notification will be delayed and motion detection sometimes doesn\\'t work other than that everything is good,The camera supports 64GB of memory card, while the online storage as mentioned in the details of 7 days rollover in India is missing.,Remember... nothing is perfect. Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup: It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1-star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app (Mi Home). It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day(!) of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn\\'t have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you\\'d need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it\\'d just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. What\\'s more! You get ads in the app right after opening it (on the dashboard where you see the list of devices) since version 5.4.43 (released on Dec 26, 2018). I wish Xiaomi released a dedicated app for home security cameras, like other companies have done.Google Assistance isn\\'t compatible with this camera, if you are into that sort of thing. Some other cameras from Xiaomi (not released in India) are supported, though.Once paired to the app and once you have the perfect setup (with NAS and good wireless bandwidth to / from the camera), you may become addicted to use it under different conditions, such as with total darkness.If you are technically sound and have around 10k budget, Raspberry Pi based home security is a better option! If you are on a budget and if you don\\'t want to spend a lot of time on technical things, then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera is the best home monitoring camera you can get!,Good enough! It works as it shown,Nice camera and easy to install. Only issus is motion censor doesn\\'t work,It\\'s good but price is high and sometime it\\'s not working so good can\\'t take motion recording.,Not up to mark Good,Excellent for mouse, keyboard & p.d.,I brought it for mi tv, it works well with laptop, while connection to tv, hard disk is not detected.,On time deliveryNice productAll ports workig,It has been purchased it has additional/external power. But adapter is not easily available. Purpose is not fullfill.,Good product and useful for laptops that have lesser number of ports.,Good,I liked this product. Its worthful.Thank you Amazon for this . Stopped working after a month of use. Don\\'t waste your money on this product,Everything is best but build quality is avg,lets get directly into the Pros & Cons :-sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy this.Pros:-* The Price, given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the Audio quality its superior for the price 499/- (i got for this price tag)*then the Comfort, everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why, if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable, so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds. as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears, But this One has SOFT CUSHION like material, im really comfortable with this one.*and next the Audio Quality, i have previosuly owned boult in-ear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality, so i booked this without even thinking twice, and it has delivered what it can. the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my in-ear earphones, the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets. but the Bass and Clarity will give you some extra feel, especially the BASS.. its really engaging, if ur a Bass lover go for it.*then the Quality, i know the Boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me, dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or Sony coz ur not paying that much for this, so for this price its so good, even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tag.Now Cons:-* little skeptical about the Warranty, because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult in-ear earphones, they didnt asked for Invoice slips and No serial number is asked, then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims?... but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality.* Next is the Cable Quality, i didnt complaining about it, but they mentioned in amazon as its an Kevlar Cable, so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its Sturdy enough.*** i didnt check the mic on it, i make a call on this, the other person was able to understand me, but i dont know hows the quality.To Help you guys, i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money (coz every single rupee counts)..Have a Nice and Safe Shopping. Bye☺️,achhi product he,Got the product delivered unharmed in 6 days.I got it for ₹499.This is the best branded product in this price range.Sound quality is pretty good considering the price.Bass is good but the loudness is a bit low, you have to listen them above the 50 level of your mobile.Clearity is very good.I bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purpose.Ear cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise, besides they aren\\'t known for passive noise cancellation.The wire attached to the ear cups is a bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefully.I have attached a pic with side by side comparison of my old Boat Rockerz 400 which I bought for ₹999 in 2018 and they lasted for a very long duration of 4 years.The Boult Audio Q2 looks a bit delicate as compared to Boat Rockerz, but don\\'t forget there\\'s a double price difference between them.Let\\'s see how long it goes....Summing up this is the best product in this price segment (₹500). Just go for it if you get the same.,Noise level is so high I couldn\\'t listen more than 5 minutes.. So I like to choose another brand please refund for this product,Quality not as expected level,I use this product for mostly in gaming and listening songs but there are no mic in it It is good and fragile, simply affixed on screen. There was a little difficulty faces as guide frame supplied is not 100% according to glass but some how i fixed it successfully. And thanks to seller for supply a pair of screen guard. Packaging was also good.,It\\'s really of good quality, I have read problems like the apple pencil doesn\\'t work after applying this protector but I honestly didn\\'t feel any lag. I rated 4 because one of the protectors created a bubble at a specific area and didn\\'t get out even after trying so hard and following all the instructions properly, and I had to use another one which got applied properly without creating any bubbles,👍🏻✅,I ended up wasting one tempered glass because of air bubbles that wouldn’t go away. I skipped wiping with micro fibre cloth which may have led to the problem. However the other glass worked fine, I had to take off my iPad cover to enable the application, the previous one wouldn’t align with the cover in place. Adhesion of the first one gave up as soon as I tried to lift and reapply, again might be attributable to the fact that I didn’t get rid of the dust particles like I should have.The one that I successfully applied, works just fine.,Good product. Decent alignment.,great product, theres no such anti glare thing, also not really good for using apple pencil, i mean the surface is not paper like thats why, one more thing it gets fingerprints really fast…application is very easy but take care there is no dust on the ipad because if a bubble’s formed you CANNOT correct it,Good, -------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It\\'s been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I\\'ve mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I\\'m quite used to it and \"I\\'m loving it\".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I\\'m keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can\\'t go wrong with this purchase. It\\'s worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can\\'t help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn\\'t find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I\\'m impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I\\'ve been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it\\'s true. So far so good. will update it after a month\\'s usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won\\'t get that ambiance. Boat\\'s website says:\"Don\\'t just be loud, be loud and clear\", Nope... sorry I\\'ve to disappoint you on this. When it\\'s loud it\\'s not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it\\'s not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I\\'m experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don\\'t know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it\\'s a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can\\'t complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it\\'s the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can\\'t find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn\\'t find this effective. Maybe it\\'s just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can\\'t make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don\\'t think Boat can beat this one\\'s quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can\\'t a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don\\'t buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I\\'d give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won\\'t regret it you won\\'t be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn\\'t find any other headphone with such a performance. We don\\'t have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don\\'t fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I\\'m not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man\\'s review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,My boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV, Laptop and my phone. I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.Value for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build, but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of  my boat headphones , i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , they\\'ve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and it\\'s still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall it\\'s very good purchase for me.,Don’t think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones. They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. Overall, I\\'m very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakas😜Sound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h🤩🤩, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhi😂😂I think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai😂😂 enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv Can buy but only when price is less,It\\'s not tht oomph feel to write...considering the name PARKER ...it\\'s like regular ball pensRather can tell the ink is too dull compared to other ball pensLot of money taken under the name PARKERIt\\'s the worth of 20/,I thought Parker would be good compared to the lousy pen. It\\'s uncomfortable.  I don\\'t use it at all.,Moneywise good,I use Parker pen because it runs fine.,The pen has a black body but blue jotter refill in it. The blue jotter writes awfully, the ink flow has reduced over time.,I\\'m using this from last 3 years. Im happy with the product.,Nice Packaging, quality, look Tips are okay, but they are small. Wondering if they took a reference of kid. They fit into the buds just fine, but have lost noise cancellation since they are really small.,Yeah it\\'s not fit for TWSs...I bought it for my tws (realme buds air 2) but it\\'s not fit I mean it\\'s not gonna close completely I\\'m talking about my Tws case!,Good product I like it,Perfect fit for my Oppo Enco M31 (green). Took few seconds to put it and it stays like the original bud. The quality is decent for its price. It’s a pack of 5.,It\\'s good and comfortable,Little tough to put on OnePlus Wireless Z headphones as the size may be a bit off. But once on, they won\\'t fall off and are pretty comfortable in ear.,Comfortable and Squeezy Fits into most Earphones likely and you dont feel uncomfortable during long hours of streaming content,Value for money. Very good quality. the color cartridge ink levels were low during printer set-up. the packaging was torn and damaged. leads me to question if this was a refurbished product that was delivered to me,Print quality  is good.,Ink gets over after a few prints,Product got delivered on next day of Order , pack was intact.many complained on the Printer ink, they pack \\'S\\' ink tanks so we cannot expect more prints , i belive , we need to wait and watch on usage.Print quality was good, good scanner.Had tough time on installing it on windows 11 , since it end up saying \"printer not connected\"Tried to reach support line and they said it is a carry in warrnty and shared the local agent number to walkin and fix.Managed to install the driver manually and able to add the printer it.we need to pick the USB (Sure it will have cannon word on it), by default it picked LTP for me and i was not able to connect to printer , After changed the USB and picked the correct connection , printer started working without any issue.will update the journey...........,Very nice Product,Good,Probably it\\'s for regular use, not for residential with few uses.The inkjets become dry too fast making it very expensive to maintain,Good I had an LG 27\" monitor and broke it twice while wiping with cloth.. It couldnt even take my ring figure pressure. First time I repaired it with huge cost, but second time had to throw it.. Then I bought this one, slightly smaller as I was afraid not to pay too much. LG had in-built speaker but this one does not. There is no speaker/mike. The picture quality is good. I have a Dell soundbar for audio/mic, so that is covered. The brightness is too much at 100% but I can reduce it to 40% which is good enough for me.The monitor includes power chord and HDMI Cable. It has a nice sturdy stand. The build quality is good. The Viewing angles are also good, with no glare from room lighting. Overall the picture quality is quite good.  The monitor also has eye care settings. There are couple of separate screws provided in a plastic cover, so be careful while unpacking. I had no missing screws problem.,I have been using for my personal and office work. It\\'s a good product when you like to splitting the screen and work simultaneously in two different windows.The experience is far great,Came with the just the OEM package slapped with invoice but the product was safePros1. 24 inch screen pixels are small enough u can see it if u try but not bad2. Ips bleed is not there but there is definitely ips glow but not that bad3.75 hz but meh i can\\'t tell the difference but again i have 120 hz phone so makes no sense to buy it for 75 hz4.colors are good movies and games pop out well5. Comes with a HDMI cable which is neat6. Build it good and angle of the monitor can be movedCons1,has like a slight yellow tint just like the redmi phone but u could get used to it2. 75 hz is a gimmick3. No display port which so bad4. Ips glow is there not much but dark things will look grey5.game mode is useless and eye blinding6.the power cable has a adapter with it which is pretty fragile if it break ur monitor is a brick VerdictI would say don\\'t buy this just for the 75hz it\\'s not worth it i would be looking into benq and lg monitor or go big and get a higher refresh rate monitor i wouldn\\'t say this was a waste of money but this definitely expensive for wat it\\'s offering,Pros:1. Good display quality2. ??That\\'s the end of ProsCons:1. WHY ON GOD\\'S GREEN EARTH THERE IS NO AUDIO JACK?!?!!!!What is the use of HDMI port if user can\\'t get VIDEO AND AUDIO both??2. IF SOMEONE IS INVESTING 10K ON A MONITOR WHY IN 2022 ANYONE WILL NEED A VGA PORT??3. Build quality is questionable, Entire build is made of plastic which is fine but for me monitor was always a little tilted no matter how hard I screwed the stand it was still the same.4. AMD Freesync isn\\'t much affective, you can still see screen tearing.5. Stand Movement is very stiff, I almost felt like I broke it. Just bad build quality.If you are only going to use HDMI port and find a workaround for audio then alright but for someone who games on PC and console both this is not good enough.If you are willing to sacrifice little bit of Visual quality and 15Hz of refresh rate which is not noticeable at all then go for BenQ, Same price but less hassle.OrBetter bump up your budget go for LG 24MK600M which goes for 13k or less but worth it,,It could have one more HDMI port,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vMbxznwhL._SY88.jpg,Perfect monitor for editing and casual gaming Good one.You can go for it.,It\\'s a really good product in every kind but i think size is quite loose. But if this is the actual size comes for 14\" laptop then I\\'m happy to have it.,,Pros:ColorSoft material of cushionsGood quality of zipCons:Material Doesn\\'t seem like water resistant one.Fit is little loose -I use 14\" HP Envy and  this 14\" laptop sleeve keeps some space in both dimensions. You can keep the charger if it\\'s small enough but you shouldn\\'t as it attracts scratches on laptop. See photos for more idea on fit. I found that 13\" laptop sleeve fits more to my preference.Try both once.,Good product,Quality of fabric is good,If you are like me and are looking for a waterproof sleeve to protect your laptop from the rain, well, this is not for you.It may be that the lining protects from splashes, but in a scenario where you get caught in the rain, water definitely makes it\\'s way inside the case and drenches the laptop. I believe the zip is the weak entry point.Other than that, it provides ample cushioning and feels fine. But yeah, NOT WATERPROOF.,Little bit improvement need Torn packing.dekhne me product used lg rha tha,I bought this color pen set for the first time and absolutely loved it. What I like the most is how easy is to keep because of the connector. The color options are neatly wide, and I like it. I would say though it\\'s not very smooth of you use it for color filling, it does get smudge if you double coat it. So, there you have to be careful and also you can\\'t order just one, it has to be two set minimum to be delivered. Thats the drawback. Otherwise, it\\'s good overall.,Eays to use for kids above 6 years,simply good,The connectors provided help to keep all the pens together. These are fine tipped pens and hence can be used for mandala designs. Just remember not to overlap and colour as this may leave a smudge.,Colour pay off is good....In this price great product,It\\'s good for beginnersThe best part about these are that they can connect so they are easy to carry them.,Good buy for the price during discount. Not used it yet as it\\'s for my niece. Good,Got a nice product,Quick not charger🤏,Cable is very good and looks durable but the pins quality are not good, infact iPhone pin keep coming out even with small movement, You can drive and charge simultaneously. Type C is good and the other pin is very hard to insert but workable.,This not a fast charger and can’t be used for data transfer. Multiple mobile can’t be charged at a time,This works as expected. It is working for both my Samsung phones and the lightning cable also works perfectly..,I loved this product for my car. It\\'s long and quite valuable for charging three mobiles together in one go.,GOOD PRODUCT. It is giving good backup.I am using it for wifi router backup but sometime on powercut, it quickly dont gives power to the wifi-router .so wifi gets turned off for some time,Talking abt this product I was confused to go with a well known brand or this brand as it was almost half rate.. I quite impressed with packaging n box content they are USPNext comes plastic quality that is also good installation was also easy by following manual.. link for video would be more helpfulIt do have sometime connecting issue that\\'s random..Which could be the reason this is reasonably priced..Next version should improve that rest happy with purchase,It provides excellent backup for above 4 hrs but during power cut the router restarts once again which created interruption in the internet connections for few minutes... Overall an Awesome Product,I have tested and it\\'s working for power back-up up to 2 hrs...,Perfect for wifi usage upto 3 hrs of power backup provided. Easy to install and use,Good products,Update 2...1. Item runs 1hr 14m @1A giving 15.465Wh, runs 48m @1.5A giving 14.82Wh whereas its rated at 22.2Wh & since its april\\'21 made, i\\'d say battery is defective & wont last me long, ordered replacement.2. Replacement runs 1h 32m @1A giving 19.39Wh, 1h 1m @1.5A giving 18.452Wh & being made in nov\\'20 i think this batt is alright. I\\'m keeping the replacement & ending my review unless item fails catastrophically.=======Update...1. This is what \"make in India\" has become- a plethora of Indian registered companies slapping their logo & selling chinese items in India, to cash in Indian sentiments. This is a generic item sold by slapping diff brand names like zinq, quantum (available right here on amazon) & prolly more. Even the boxes r exactly same... lol.2. Recharge rate is horribly slow @0.5A, so 2.2Ah will take 4.4hrs, considering losses 4.5hrs. That\\'s why frequent power cut ppl r complaining about 1hr standby. So its basically for ppl with occasional power cuts (like me with community generator).3. Ups has to be turned ON to recharge... what? why? lame! This is another reason ppl r complaining about charging issue & since item is generic, ZINQ prolly doesn\\'t even know... lol... such a dumb thing must be printed on the center of the box itself. I myself was fooled for 6hrs thinking that its charging but it went cold so checked with power meter & wow! It didn\\'t charge a bit.4. Had i been younger with lotza free time, i could\\'ve made one myself for ₹80+80+80+150+50 for 1.8Ah one... Gone r those fun days! So I\\'m keeping it for ₹1001.** if any1 is reading my review, youtube search for \"router ups\" & lotza young ppl with free time have made such DIY.===============Damn this thing can output over 35watts of power @12v. For the 1st time something has out-specked my 35w load tester.Pros-1. Can output 3A or even more, that i could test. Great for sudden load surge.2. Very stable output 12-12.1v throughout 0-35w.3. Solid built, almost all possible connectors provided, seamless switching from AC to battery (obviously), easy to use.Cons-1. No polarity changing option for in/out. Some items/chargers do have center negative, for that i have to make my own cable.2. Since it went 3A or above, i dont think theres any overload/short circuit protection.3. Item got quite hot when run at 12v 2A for 15mins. I hope theres thermal protection.4. Item is sealed shut. Any repair or future battery change will be destructive.,It works as intended and gives 4-5 hours battery backup for wi-fi. The product doesn\\'t feel premium. I would say it\\'s a good product given the price.,Able to hold all your individual wires and hard disk etc.,BECOMES TOO TIGHT IF MOBILE CHARGER AND CHARGING BANK ARE PLACED,I keep my small gadgets and cables organized inside my bag. Could be better if it had more space for at least  small boxes, adapters etc,Good product!! Has quite a few compartments and can keep a lot of stuff. Has re-adjustable brackets in one the sections where items (of varrying sizes) can be stored. Has enough pockets to carry multiple pen drives and chargers. Inner padding is slightly foamy so it does provide decent drop protection. If you are tight on budget, go for it.,It does what it is meant for , all your wires chargers are in one place , you can go for it ! Not that luxurious but at this price it\\'s definitely worth having it than loosing your wires,Good,Quality of marerial Working fine,very good this data cable,Performance of this product is good enough.,Have been using it since quite a well. It is doing an excellent job. You can also avail the warranty by just messaging the serial number on whatsapp. Super happy with the overall performance.,Good data cable same as shown in pic. I brought this for my Nikon d5600 photos transfer to system.,Superb product...👌👌👌,Better,Seems to fast charge at 2A , not tried anything higher, but its a very sturdy cable should last for a long time Some keys could be better but in this budget it\\'s good enoughI use to play GTA 5 and fifa and some car racing games which are so goodAnd vibration is so good in this budget,Good for this budget,The product worked fine for 6 months but after that, the start button and select button of the controller went inside and it became defective and it stopped working. So I had to wait for weeks for the buttons to come back up and for it to work again. Since those two buttons are not crucial for playing the game, it was manageable to some extent.,Tbh it\\'s good.... If you are a amateur gamer it\\'s completely fine at this price...but If you are hardcore gamer pro level then I will suggest you to pay a bit more and go for a better one because sometimes out of no reason some movements doesn\\'t work ...when i Play cricket suddenly in the middle of the match one shot selection doesn\\'t work and it disrupts the momentum...... Still it\\'s a decent product... Can\\'t say about durability now will update few months later.,Less weight compared to other sticksThe L2 and R2 is little hard but still playableBattery backup is goodThe charging port is B that\\'s not a good thing because we all are using C port chargersAlthough for this price point it\\'s okay,I have been using this for 3 weeks now and I saw no flaws with this one. The L2 and R2 are a bit tight, but other than that no issues! I ruff use a lot when playing and this is very durable, (although it does not have markings for grip) the grip is good too. This one needed no extra installations and is a plug and play. Just what I needed!,Doesn\\'t support all the time on windows 11. The device is not recognisable most of tge times and you just need to plug and unplug the thing continuously., (Realme Buds Wireless design and  specifications)Truly wireless earphones are becoming very popular, and we could very well see Realme get into that space in the coming months. However, for now, the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form — neckband-style earphones. The headset has a flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends, short cables that lead to the earbuds, and the plastic earbuds themselves. We quite liked the yellow-and-black colour scheme of our review unit. The design is simple and the build quality is decent. The device is light at just 30g, and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at a stretch.Like earlier Realme earphones, the Realme Buds Wireless have magnets in each earbud. While they don\\'t serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together, the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the Realme Buds Wireless. Separating the buds turns the headset on, while attaching them powers it down; there is no power button, so this is the only way to control power on the headset.In theory this sounds good, but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in a bag or pocket. This would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didn\\'t want it to, which was bothersome. Calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphone\\'s earpiece without us knowing, the battery would run down, and the phone wouldn\\'t automatically connect to other devices such as a Bluetooth car audio system.What you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips, ear wings that are pre-attached to the earbuds, and a Micro-USB cable for charging. The charging port is on the underside of the right module, which also has the controls for playback, calls, and volume.The Realme Buds Wireless earphones are powered by 11.2mm drivers, with Bluetooth 5 and support for the SBC and AAC codecs. The earphones have a claimed battery life of 12 hours on a single charge, and are said to offer 100 minutes of listening time on a 10-minute charge when the battery is drained. We were able to get around 9 hours of use in our testing, while a full charge of the headset took a little under 3 hours to complete.🤩🤩🤩🔥  (Realme Buds Wireless performance)The Realme Buds Wireless bring a refreshing change to the budget segment, offering a great combination of design and sound quality for the price. Also, fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the Realme Buds Wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular DJ Alan Walker, and the sound does come across as geared for this genre. the wireless earphones with use AAC Bluetooth codecs. We listened to streamed music from Spotify and YouTube Music, as well as our collection of high-resolution tracks.🎧🎛️🎶Starting with Take Five by the Dave Brubeck Quartet, we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what we\\'re typically used to hearing from products in this price range. Some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined, although the deeper elements in the middle of the track — the double-bass, in particular — was a bit soft and not quite as distinct as we\\'d have liked. Still, we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the whole.Next, we listened to a bit of Indian pop with an Unplugged rendition of Amar Arshi\\'s Kala Chasma. Apart from some gentle aggression in the low end, we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs, as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track. The sound of the Realme Buds Wireless is tuned for comfort and near-universal appeal, and sticks to that brief. We heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from a pair of wireless earphones that cost less than Rs. 2,000.the Realme Buds Wireless as a hands-free headset for voice calls, and results were mixed. In some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft, and our callers reported too much background noise — a crow cawing about 20 feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us, for the person on the other end. On other occasions, no issues were reported, so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal.  (Verdict)More expensive pairs of earphones such as the OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 and 1More Stylish Dual Dynamic Driver might offer much more by way of sound quality, but the Realme Buds Wireless does a capable job for just Rs. 1,799. This is a product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the price.This headset is built well, has decent battery life, and is very comfortable to wear. The only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch, which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times. That aside, the Realme Buds Wireless is a pair of earphones that does exactly what it\\'s supposed to - no more and no less — with unwavering consistency, and we like it for that.Pros⚫1  Looks good🔥2  Light and comfortable3  Detailed, rich sound for the priceCons⚫1  Magnetic power switch is troublesome2  Inconsistent performance on voice callsRatings (out of 5)Design/ comfort: 4.0Audio quality: 3.8Battery life: 4.5Value for money: 4.8Overall: 4.0Go and purchased🙂👍,First of all if you are a Electronic/Dance and Hip/Hop Genre kind of enthusiast than your search for a good quality earphone \"\"STILL CONTINUES\", it\\'s not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these, surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphones.From My music listening experience from 8 Years i can tell you that the Depth and that vibrating+ Surround base effect is not in this ( it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre) but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if you\\'re a Hip/Hop &EDM lover (THE MID TONES OF MUSIC ARE A LITTLE LOW IN THIS EARPHONE WHICH ALSO RUINS A LITTLE THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE GENRE\\'S SONG LISTENING EXPERIENCE).THIS WANNA MAKES ME THINK EVERYTIME IS ALAN WALKER REALLY TUNED THIS???FOR TRAP & HARD DANCE GENRE IT\\'S GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST.I can tell you such differences because I am also using a wired earphone namely MI Earphones PRO (1799 rs) which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effect!!RATHER THAN FOR THOSE GENRE\\'S SONG THESE EARPHONES ARE REALLY GOOD FOR EVERY OTHER GENRES !!!If You\\'re Fine with the above listed drawbacks Then only head towards the detailed review!!:::::::UPSIDES:::::::1. THE MATERIAL QUALITY IS GOOD, ITS PLASTIC BUT FEELS LIKE A SOFT SILICON LAYER IS APPLIED OVER ITS TOP LAYER (BOTH ON THE NECKBAND AS WELL AS THE WIRES OF THE EARPLUGS).2. THESE ARE EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT AND DOESN\\'T FEELS A LIKE EXTRA LOAD ON YOUR NECK AT ALL.3. NOISE CANCELLATION IS REALLY VERY GOOD, I\\'M REALLY IMPRESSED.4. MIC QUALITY IS ALSO THE BEST THAT CAN BE OFFERED IN 2000 RANGE (No Complaints)5. THE EARPLUGS FIT IS GOOD (BUT I ADVICE YOU TO REMOVE THOSE REMOVABLE ANGULAR PADDINGS FOR MORE SNUG FIT) AND COMFORT IS FINE (BUT COULD BE MORE BETTER AS MY WIRED ONE\\'S ARE REALLY MORE COMFORTABLE AND IF YOU HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THIS, THEN YOU CAN ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT\\'S COMFORT FOR LONG USE).6. THE BLUTOOTH RANGE IS REALLY GOOD (STILL WORKS IF 2 ROOMS ARE IN BETWEEN)7. THE MAGNETIC ON/OFF CONTROL IS LIKE CHERRY ON CAKE AND WORKS LIKE CHARM!(WHEN YOU SEPERATE THEM IT TAKES 3-4 SECONDS TO CONNECT WITH YOUR PHONE IF ALREADY PAIRED BEFORE AND IF PHONES BT IS ON, AND IF YOU ATTACH THEM TOGETHER THEY GO TO STANDBY MODE AND GOES OFF IF NOT OPENED AGAIN WITHIN 5 MINUTES, IT\\'S REALLY GOOD THAT YOU\\'RE GETTING THIS MAGNETICFUNCTION IN THIS PRICE!!)8. SOUND CAN GO REALLY LOUD BUT I PREFER TO USE IT ON 60-70 %9. MICRO USB CABLE + 2 PAIR OF EXTRA EARTIPS (SMALL & LARGE) ARE PROVIDED IN BOX (MEDIUM IS PRE-APPLIED AND IS PERFECT NEARLY FOR EVERYONE)10. BATTERY BACKUP IS GOOD (EXPECT 8 HOURS OF CONTINUOS PLAYBACK ON 70% VOLUME)11. CHARGING SPEED IS ALSO GOOD, YOU CAN EASILY GET 1 HOUR OF PLAYBACK ON 1O MINUTES OF CHARGE!, AND CAN FULLY CHARGE IT AROUND 90-100 MINUTES IF FULLY EMPTY.12. DID NOT GET TO EXPERIENCE ITS SPLASH RETENTION PROPERTY.::::::DOWNSIDES::::::1. THE OUTER COVER OF EARPHONES ARE OF PLASTIC (GOOD QUALITY), BUT THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALUMINIUM FRAME IN THIS PRICE.2. THE WIRES SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN AS BRAIDED ONE (FOR ROUGH AND LONG USE)3. NO REALME BRANDING (PERMANENT) ANYWHERE ON THE EARPHONE CONFUSES US, BUT THERE\\'S TAG ATTACHED ON THE NECKBAND4. THE CAP ON THE CHARGING PORT SHOULD HAVE GIVEN TO PREVENT DUST FROM ENTERING.5. SMALL CARRY CASE OR POUCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO MAKE IT TRAVEL FRIENDLY6. WHEN CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE WHEN THERE IS AN INCOMING CALL IT DOESN\\'T RECITES THE NUMBER OF CALLER, AND IT SOMETIMES DOESN\\'T NOTIFIES AT ALL... **BUT NO MAJOR CON IS THERE**:::::::::::::::::::::::SOUND QUALITY:::::::::::::::::::::::::1. THE VOCALS ARE REALLY AMAZING & NOW I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE LYRICS OF POP SONGS 😆.2. THE LOWS AND HIGHS OF THE SONGS ARE REALLY GREAT BUT MIDS ARE LITTLE SUPRESSED AND YOU WOULD DEFINITELY MISS THAT IN EDM AND HIP-HOP SONGS (as that evary low details are not required in dance songs, the Mids & Highs are more important)3. THE BASE IS ADEQUATE AND KEEPS THE SONG ALIVE BUT NOT PRODUCES THAT WELL DEEP AND SURROUND BASE THAT YOUNGSTER\\'S LOVE, BUT IT DEFINITELY HAS THAT AMOUNT OF BASE REQUIRED IN ANY SONG TO FEEL IT, I\\'M ALSO A YOUNSTER AND I\\'M FINE WITH IT AS I\\'VE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE FOR WATCHING MOVIES AND SERIES ON TV SILENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING MY FAMILY SO THIS FULFILLS MY PURPOSE.4. THE BEAT AND SOUND PRODUCED FEELS NATURAL AND CLEAR LIKE HIGH QUALITY HEADPHONES AND IN THIS RESPECT ALAN WALKER AND REALME TEAM HAD SURELY DONE A GREAT WORK.5. BASED ON TYPES OF MUSIC LOVERS I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO:- POP, INDIE-POP, ACOUSTIC, R&B, Rock and soft Rock, TRAP/HARD DANCE & NEARLY ALL KINDS OF GENRES EXCEPT EDM AND HIP-HOP...AS I\\'VE BOUGHT IT AS A SECONDARY EARPHONE SO I DO NOT HAD ANY GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND I CAN SURELY SAY THAT IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS AND I\\'M VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE....PLEASE READ THE WHOLE REVIEW IT WILL SURELY HELP YOU DECIDE MORE CLEARLY.HAVE A GOOD PURCHASING EXPERIENCE, THAKYOU FOR READING!!!,Best but little high price.6to 12 month daily use he chal pata h ..,The base is so loud. you can\\'t listen for long, you will get ear pain after 1 hour.

In this price range:)I m really happy 😊,I love to this product,This product is really good as for the money, sensor is good, lights look cool, bass is good, battery backup is also good. Best thing is its Bluetooth connectivity which is super fast. Only limitation is that it connects to only 1 device at a time. Highly Recommended., I liked everything like product quality, packaging was so premiumOne thing I didn\\'t liked is you can get fingerprint easily,Standard Cover for the price. Need a little common sense to apply, could use help of your local shops. Decent product, could be little cheaper. Spen works after applying.,Good product though bit costly.,Not smudge proof at all!! But apart from that it\\'s,The glass fits perfectly around the screen. It is completely transparent and has no black edges. Cutout for the front cam is perfect as well.,Very easy to install,The screen guard is of good quality but it sometimes creates problems in writing with the s pen. Not an issue but just for the information. Overall good and value for money.,The seller is basically lying by saying anti scratch and smudge proof as it is clearly not.Pros - Durable, not cracks during 1 year of use.Cons- Heavy smudge that you have to wipe constantly and scratches appear with regular use. good,Good product,Good product ....,Previously I was thinking of buying the Orico one but now I think buying this was a good decision, no cons till now.,* Good build quality* Easy to use* Looks good* Great transfer speed,,Does all it says, Great product for the price.,Nice and value for money SanDisk 1TB Extreme Pro Portable SSD 2000MB/s R/WInitially set up the disk with inbuilt san disk software. The speed was pathetic and after some debugging found culprit in exFat default format. Reformatted to APFS (Encrypted) for similar secure features without comprising features. Surprised to see drastic jump in performance .ExFAT - 48gb write failed after 30 mins.APFS Encrypted - 48gb - less than 4 mins.Pros -PortableSecureSturdySpeedLarge volumeCons-Default software and filesystem.,Will deliver speed in range 7** to 9** MBps on MBP as thunderbolt 4 will only function as 10GBps (USB 3.1) mode instead of 20GBps (usb 3.2),Good,Sandisk is always Excellent! Though this review is about Sandisk Extreme which functions excellently, it is painful to note that this cannot be used in my IPad Pro ( costing more than a Lac rupees), whereas this responsed to my Samsung Tab of Rs.25000 (without any aid of Computer or PC)  flawlessly. Shame on Apple!,I am using this device for the past 1month and the read and write speed is mind-blowing. I especially liked it\\'s portability as well as it is easy to carry and you can use this device on the even on your mobile or laptop. It\\'s waterproof as well rugged . I use this device for my daily use.  Thank you SanDisk for making this device,Had it been up to rs 5000, the middle family would have been able to buy it easily.,Speed is very fast. but it corrupts video file. when i download video files direct into this drive (from internet) files get corrupt.,Perfect travel partner with taking no space at all in my bag. The sound quality at this price is unbelievable. The colour changing lights at first might be distracting but you get used to it and it works beautifully with both, PC and laptop.,Its alright.,For the price this is a good buy.,Small and cute speakers with good sound quality.,sound quality is really good for this price range,Great sound quality, if only they had an option to disable the lights,It gets annoying after some time,, Good looking amd working fine.,I brought this primarily because my Lenovo Laptop (Windows 11) has only one USB 3 port, no ethernet slot and one c-connector port.While in office immediately after purchase of this TP-Link UE330 3-Port USB Hub and Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, I used this for the ethernet connectivity to my office network.  Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard-disk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs (two numbers) and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. It’s compatible with all. It’s plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I’m working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it’s not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would’ve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn’t make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps. Thanks. i am writing this review after 2 months, the first cable had a cut and had to be replaced, the second cable is working fine, no issues, using it to charge me PS3 controller, works fine, at a good price, planning to pick up another one as a spare.,Product OK.,I bought this cable to charge my 10w Bluetooth speaker and its working as expected.,It\\'s lengthy and usable for car dashcam.Quality is average and micro type B end does sit very tight.Otherwise, it\\'s all good.But keep checking price of amazon basics cable of this type , price drops many times. That\\'s better quality.,This is one of the good product in this price range. Quality is okay,Using it for my laptop cooling pad. Overall build looks sturdy, but longevity cannot confirm. Also, YOU CANNOT CONNECT 2 PCs USING A MALE TO MALE USB. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. Stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was NOT intended for.Can confirm that it is ~1.2m as most other products and not 1.5m as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the product.No review mentions this. But I needed a 1.5m length for perfect use. So disappointed as I have to rotate the cooling pad and use it (cable falls short by around 15cm).,It works well. The cable is soft and flexible. In all probability, it will last long also.,But pover quality I ordered this product 1 week ago on Amazon but then I got a defective piece, the case charger was faulty so I contacted with customer care and they agreed to replace it..after confirmation of faulty piece, within 4 days i recieved my replacement pack and this time it\\'s charging well..😀 hopefully I don\\'t have to edit this and it stays with me for a long time!,Good earbuds at low price.Bass is good, sound is high.No noise cancellation as described in the images.Only noise isolation is present.Used it for a week without charging. No charging issues.Build quality is plastic and can feel it.Ear buds tips aren\\'t comfortable for long  listening. But ok for upto 2 hrs.No highs, no mids, no lows. But are stereo enabled.One can\\'t expect a bose or apple quality at 4% of their price.So finally justice done for the price paid.If one don\\'t want to spend high, one can\\'t expect a better quality than this.,More often than not you find TWBs that are expensive or don\\'t fit well, or one has a problem with sound quality.But at this price point these buds are exceptional.I bought them for use at night just before sleeping... They don\\'t come out of your ear making it comfortable to sleep with. The sound quality is decent with no misses on mids and voice quality over calls is good.,Pros:1) Overall sound quality is better than other brands. Bass is good. Go for it, if you got for ears for some good listening. The distinctions are good.2) It is Comfortable and fits on ear for casual hearing.3) Battery lasts long. I bearly use for 2-3 hours a day.and charge once in a week or 10 days once.Cons:1) Not recommended for calls. Noise cancellation for calls is poor.2) Not comfortable for sporting activities. Mostly fits well but comparatively slips easily, than the traditional designed ones.3) Touch controls are uneasy, as the touch point is above the hearing point.,Sabhi kuch accha hai lakin battery backup may kamjor hai, 50% Kay bad bhaut jadi battery khatam hote hai.baki sab kuch accha hai.,A very good product till i have used..keep it up,I liked it but it was not up to my hopes as stopped working just after return window got closed,I feel it\\'s not worth spending INR 5,000 - 20,000, this product is definitely the best in the market at this price range.My expectation with this product was simple: to offer good noise cancellation and up-to-mark battery backup, which is delivered.I have used it for the last 3 months., except for a few fluctuations while listening to music.Used it for calls and gaming, and I\\'m satisfied.Lastly, if you are looking for the purpose of calling, this device and all others fulfil the requirement but in my experience of using different kinds of products, I felt a need for a silent room for the purpose of calling.Highly recommend this product, much better than the other high-range products. Mouse open cover was little less quality,Excellent keyboard.  Keys are big and comfortable.  Keyboard is super silent.  Keyboard is compacter tahn a full size keyboard.  Only con is the mouse which is super small even for my average size palm.  Otherwise, the mouse is smooth only after you twitch the mouse settings in Windows settings and only on smooth surfaces.  On a computer mat it would be a little jumpy and rough.  Only wish the mouse was a bit larger.,I love this product. Very nice one. Works very well.,The combo of mouse and keyboard is off really good quality. The key travel is really great on these. Although it would have been great if the mouse had been a bit power efficient as the keyboard as it eats up the single AAA battery quite fast. Also would’ve liked a power switch on keyboard.,Some times blutooth connection problem occurs,First of all as in this price range it\\'s pretty good but the comfort while pressing keys is not good..If we press one key automatically itbis touching another key without any intention...U can buy it for 1k but above u can go Logitech products...,Easy to connect, good looking, value for money, easy to type and click,Good + Good product+ Cheap and best for alternative ink refilling+ Print quality is okay+ Well packed+ We can refill 3 times compared to original ink+ There is no different between original and this one+ Really i am satisfied+ Don\\'t waste your money for only brand lables,Good quality Ink,Like. Im using this product for office cañon printer.,Without thinking just go for it, it prints so well and you will never regret! Got it in an affordable price !,I have used them before they bear good print quality and the bottle quality is also nice. I can say these are economical,In this product.. Ink Quality is too Good,Very good ink as expected 😊. And genuine product. And my g3010 printing is fine. No head problem. Thank you seller for good packing and amazon .,Very good product I always use it Good product under 800it has 3 pots for mic headphone and usb for led glow you will require a splitter for laptopgreat product for online tutors as I also purchased for the same ..try this product if looking for budget headphone for CPU for gaming and online classes,Very decent headphones. The mic is also very good. Durability needs time to tell. The last Redgear lasted about 2 years.,It\\'s so comfortable to wear,I have even tried the Cosmic Byte Gs430 from the same price range, though i find these pair to be more value for money.Comfort- They are comfortable, the earcups are very soft and recommended if you do gaming for longer periods of time.Design- The design is actually pretty good considering the price range.Mic- the microphone\\'s quality is actually great considering the price.Connectivity- recommended if your pc/laptop has a seperate mic and sound jack. You have to buy a splitter if you want to use the mic on a mobile. What I\\'ve noticed with other headsets is they provide a single jack for sound and mic output. But these come with 2 jacks so thats a plus point.Sound quality- These pair of headphones are only recommended for casual gaming and media consumption, the sound quality while gaming is fine, although it doesn\\'t have that 7.1 sound but still i was able to figure out the footsteps, i also use the windows sonic for headphones and that helps too.However, at this price don\\'t expect a good sound quality if you listen to music. The max volume feels low and the bass is almost non existent. The treble, highs and lows are done fine but buy these pair only if your priority is gaming and you are at a budget.,See the headphones are good if u are purchasing in 500to 600₹ but let me tell u don\\'t have good surround sound ,mic volume is too low you can\\'t increase it and no bass,The Headset is overall good. Its sound quality and build quality is appreciated. At the same time, I have a few concerns, first of all, it gives a lot of pressure on both ears. So after an hour, it starts hurting.  My laptop has one input for audio. This has two. So, you have to buy an extra pin to connect it. Otherwise, go for it.,This headphone is to good in low price, Noise Cancellation is working properly , also u can adjust Volume as your choice. I\\'m using this headphone for my Live Stream.1 problem , if your head is big, it will fit properly otherwise moving.,This product is decent. Base is low but it is good in the given price range Not too good not too bad,If you have the trust of Amazon basics then go for it. I am writing this review after using it for 18 months. Still as sturdy and durable as the new one.,Nil,Used it for a fortnight till now in my car for mobile charging. Works well.,Not working with Fast Charger , if you are planning to use with normal charger , its pretty good . Product quality too its GOOD.,I\\'m using this cable since 1 years and currently this cable is running perfectly without any problems.If you want to buy best type-c cable then without thinking buy it.,Does not support display only work to connect network and charging,Good and useful Material os very good, initially charges very fast but after 7 months saw a diffrence in speed, I contacted seller for warranty, within 1 day they delivered me new one without any cost.Great product  good service.,Costly but good product,Wire can be a bit soft..it is very hard to get it fold,Product is good but I need replacement asap. Cause it\\'s stopped working.,The cable is physically resilient and looks good too. The cable stopped working in 7 months - contacted customer support and they ensured a replacement soon. All in all, a hassle-free warranty claim.Shall share an update once I get the replacement.,Very sturdy cable, best fit for rough n tough use.,Very nice cable,Very good product Original 3rd Jan 2021: This is my first smartwatch. I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and I\\'m aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one (GTS2/GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc) with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa (yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update). I\\'d have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display (has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro). It still isn\\'t released in India.Coming to the watch\\'s performance, the typical features I tried today (first day) are Heart RATE (HR), SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch aren\\'t very accurate to my surprise (heart rate variation by 5-10 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10% points at times) . But I still feel it\\'s more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It won\\'t surprise me if I don\\'t get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldn\\'t control the phone camera as I couldn\\'t get that feature to work (refer to image and help me if you can). I didn\\'t face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.To conclude, I wouldn\\'t say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy (at least the Honor bands I\\'ve seen). Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as I\\'m curious what all it can do.I would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Let\\'s see.Update (8th Jan 2021): The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. I\\'m hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device (4) and the app (57). Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didn\\'t dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didn\\'t have an issue, but could not clear individual items (clear all worked),REVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS 2 Mini Smart watch (2021 model)Hello everyone . Since the new model of amazfit GTS2 mini arrived , i am going to review the old model of itPros:Display : 1.55 inch amoled display , really good look . ( pros)Battery : coming with 220 maH , from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer ( normal use ) . But If you are a light user ,it can last it for 14 days . (Pro)IP rating :IP 68 water resistant which is cool .(Pro)Heartbeat sensor : It has heartbeat sensor and it is real , but it may not show real accuracy at all the time . But it performs good (pro)Comfortness : It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material. (pro)Work out modes : There are nearly 70+ workout modes and i tested out some , since it is built in GPS , it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well. (pro)can track stressHas PAI feature to progress your workout with better experienceAlexa assistant ( but need phone connection to activate this )Has other modes like breathing ,menstrual cycle tracking,to-do-list , inbuilt alarm ,pomodoro timer ,sleep tracker ,Timer , In built compass , camera remote ,find the phone , controlling music etc.Notification system : you can get notifications .Call control system : You can accept or reject calls , but you cannot able to talk through watch.Cons:Build quality :it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium . and half is poly carbonate (con) .Watch faces : the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good . (con)SPO2 : I don\\'t know how much accurate it is , but coming to technical part , the sensors are failing most of the times . Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history .(con)Verdict :It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality .,The incoming call notification disconnects if you\\'re away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch. I have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors, even though it\\'s not Damaged. Water resistance is good. I used to wash dishes wearing it. No use of Alexa.i think it\\'s a good buy after 2 months of usage,all over Amazfit GTS2 Mini (New Version) is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback. apart for this other things are really nice.,Sleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watch.Rather all thing are fantastic and battery life is 7 day in normal uses Product is good and better🙂Not bad,Value for money,It\\'s not water resistant, but it\\'s its quality is good .,For the price tag it very good buy. Made of Good Quality Clothe materials. 3-4 zip chain compartments including laptop one. planty of space. From inside waterproof material used. Stitching is good. Although to be keep on mind is that even it is made for 15inch laptop this wont fit with some old generation laptops or any gaming laptops coz they are thick so only office/normal laptop from current generation will fit easily as they are slim.,The product is good quality as it can easily carry my laptop with charger and headphone. I was looking for such bag since long and the blue color is really appealing. The cloth material I liked because it is water repellent, so need not worry about little rain as well.  The smaller pocket can easily hold wallet / mouse or any small goodies. Overall, I liked this product. Thanks!! Tabelito,Product quality is good. Easy to carry 14-15 inches laptop with charger. Bag having two small pocket where you can carry small things. Fabric is awesome and blue color looks more attractive.Superb stitching and finishing. It has a trolly bag support trap as well. Great for every day office bag and also for 1-2 days business trip.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WqT8CoY6L._SY88.jpg,1st of all within Rs 300 I got this loot deal. If you found this deal inthis price just go for it. Quality isnt compromised for this price at all I must say. Will update my review if any quality issues I will face. But for now I am very much happy with my bag. Not a smudge proof but gives a gorilla glass feel. Lovely product!,Not smudge proof leaves a lot of finger print marks, rest is ok,Very Nice,Proper fit and doesn\\'t let in bubbles if you know how to install a tempered glass. Definitely not smudge proof but no scratches observed till now.,Good screen protector, almost cover entire screen just few millimeter sapce gets left form edges,Nice glass,,Saying good bye to delivery of poor quality product and Amazon current policies to run away by providing poor product and poor resolution to complaints. Go and buy products from market.

After pressing erase button for 2-3 times, I am able to get the clear screen which is quite frustrating and I think this might be a battery issue and if it is then company should work on that. Also this erase button wipes out everything at once so no scope of making mistake, you cannot erase any particular info on screen, the complete screen erases at once. Otherwise it\\'s very handy, saves lot of paper for rough work and a good product in this range when compared to other ruffpads.,ok for remainder,Good one.It should have pen holder,First impressions are awesome.hope  it work well for one year 🥺🥺 build quality amazing all amazing simply go For it Nice product.

This is a good easy to clean deskmat. The mouse glides nicely and my keyboard holds the position, Both are required conditions for my kind of usage.It was  packed and delivered well in good condition.With both sides usable one can use this mat interchangeably.,Feels like a premium desk mat compared to the other mats I had tried from Amazon and the color scheme is also well thought out. Very easy to clean as well since the surface is kind of slippery and not very soft.,It’s been few weeks now, hence posting the review.This desk spread was available in my budget and looks great so went for it and now while it’s in use, it’s work as expected. I went for the Yellow and Blue one & as of this moment I am using the yellow side up as its in contrasts with my desk.Love the feel.Keeps my desk clean and free from scratches.Also easy to clean.Just go for it.#bhavneetapproved 😀,Good quality mat. Initially, i had to flatten it out properly but once set, it is the best.

Proper thickness allows it to use as writing base and also gets back to original shape after prolonged laptop usage. Overall extremely satisfied.,Very durable and easy to clean and looks great on the desk,does fade a but overall a good mat Standard calculator. What you expect from a 12Digit calculator. Nothing more, nothing less,Excellent product,Good.,I Like this product. The product is genuine onky,Super product,Very good,Very average product,No issue with the product. Worth the price. I use the local cable providers set up. With my previous tv (Samsung) I was not facing this problem.  The only problem I am facing is each time I turn off the tv from the mains, I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don\\'t know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years. Bought this tv with 2 year warranty on panel.,improve the software response and improve the picture quality. worth for money for this budget (4K).,I have used 2-4 days. Picture quality looks good and impressive. Go for it..Hope long-term quality is also good.,This tv is very good but in this one thing bad is tha this tv some time get stop while playing only YouTube video but otherwise it\\'s a good product,It’s good and value for money,Amazing pic and sound quality. 4K quality at this price.

This doesn\\'t look presentable.,Very good product in that cost...,Good Good,Amazing,Nice pen and keychain,I just live it,This is the best thing to gift other,Good,good,I bought it for my sister\\'s Kid who\\'s 11years old because he has a wish of using Parker Pen. So I made his wish come true. I really liked this router for a smallish space. The coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent.However it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. Apparently the Ethernet port got damaged somehow. I tried calling TP Link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. It\\'s the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a year\\'s usage. And to make it worse there\\'s dismal after sales service.I tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasn\\'t stable. I think I\\'ll finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. Hopefully I\\'ll find a good maker .,Good Router,After researching lot I settled on TP link A6,I was looking for better range router, this Router really worth the price. Dual band, guest wifi. I upgraded from tenda n301, and performance is really good.Range for 5Gz is not that good as 2.5Gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than this.,I was using Tenda AC 10 router (since 2019) for 100Mbps connection from Local ISP (Mach1 Broadband, Mumbai). Most of devices (5 Mobiles, 4 Laptops, 1 Firestick) at my home work on 5Ghz except 1 CCTV camera. Range of Tenda AC 10 was good and used Digisol AC750 repeater for farthest room of my 2 BHK home.In recent lightning strike in Mumbai, power adapter of Tenda AC10 got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter. I was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget. I tried 2 routers (Mercusys AC1900 MR50G & TP Archer C80 AC1900) before this. Both Routers didn\\'t meet my expectation. Range and speed of these 2 routers were poor than my earlier Tenda AC10. Amazon accepted returns without a single question. Thumbs up to Amazon.After some more research, I zeroed on TP link Archer A6 & C6. As per comparison on TP link website both are identical routers. After doing some more research on blogs and reviews, I found that Archer A6 is the latest model and had slightly better processor (both from Qualcomm). Hence purchased Archer A6. Feature of Onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future. Separate Wifi SSID (with same strength on both 2.4 & 5 Ghz) as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser, as per TP link support page, this is dedicated wifi link for Onemesh repeaters.Now for router, Router is same as Tenda AC10 for coverage, it can not cover farthest room in 2BHK on 5Ghz. 2.4 Ghz band can cover 2BHK house, but speed is around 30 Mbps on 100 Mbps plan. However, speed on Archer A6 is better that Tenda AC10. I\\'m getting 90 Mbps upload and download consistently on devices 5~15 feet apart in 5Ghz. TP Link Archer A6 is better than costlier AC1900 routers. Just for info, I received US version (v2) of router instead of EU version mentioned on TP Link India website. Hence, firmware on TP Link India website will not match with device firmware. However, this device has auto update option directly from Internet. Also, router can be managed by TP-Link Tether app remotely (on internet even tough not connected on same wifi) by login using TP link account on both router and Tether app.By trying so many routers, i understood that 5Ghz range will be week even with costliest router. Instead of using Digisol AC750 repeater, i installed my old Tenda AC10 in repeater mode for 5Ghz (2.4 Ghz disabled). Now my complete home is covered by 5Ghz signal. In the farthest room i receive download & upload speed of around 75 Mbps.I also tried old TP link Archer C50 which i had purchased when abroad, performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks Gigabit ports, Beam-forming & MU-MIMO.My ISP has connected my link on Gigabit port of their switch in my society. However, cabling is only 2 pair CAT 5e which supports max 100 Mbps (full duplex). I will try to get cabling changed to either 4 Pair CAT 5E or CAT6 from ISP and check the performance. I will update review after cabling change.So in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with Gigabit ports, Beam-forming & MU-MIMO even if your internet speed is less than 100Mbps as it is future proof. TP Lnk Archer A6 is good router meeting all requirement within the budget.Hope this review is useful in search of good future-proof router.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit 1:My ISP tried to replace my connection to FTTH and this router was connected to Fiber ONU using Gigabit Port. It worked only for 15 mins. Max speed was 230 Mbps. ISP was not able to resolve the FTTH issue and changed cable to 4 Pair CAT-5e, which supports Gigabit transmission. Now net speed is around 160 Mbps. My internet plan is 100 Mbps. I\\'m happy with the speed. I have asked ISP to change my connection to FTTH at last. Tenda AC10 is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of Archer A6 using CAT5e cable. Now complete home received stable wifi of 160 Mbps on 5Ghz band.I will update once again when FTTH connection is successful.,Good product till now 1 month,I am very Satisfied.,I am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and I used to reconnect it and the same way VPN  is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting.. Now I am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well.. Finally i am not seeing any issue with this router.. It is helping me during work from home 🏠,Please go ahead,Its easy to use, easy to install , more function to control the router Working well and fast Charing as claimed. Pice is at highside. Good item.,Good working worth of money 💰,It is an awesome cable i got it from Amazon. Do charge my phone in a fast way.,The cable is good in quality and charges fast , got it in good deal in the sale .,It\\'s not a fast charger. It says fast charge but it takes forever to charge. But the wire is strong and durable.,Super fast,Charging very fast👍Good product 👍,Works for both DASH and WARP Charging. Good build quality. Wifi ability to connect with the printer is not very good,I did my first print and ink gone quickly as water evaporates under sun. LolI\\'m doing an exchange.,Good products and Very good print Quality.,The printer came loosely put into the HP printer box without any of the usual styrofoam packing. It was rattling in the box before being opened.After a couple of days of very light use, probably no more than 10-20 pages, both printer cartridges ran low, and the black already ran out. I had to replace it.When I was installing the printer, I had noticed that the cartridges did not have the protective tape over them. Didn’t think much of it then.It feels like this was a printer that was being used somewhere and they put it into a new box when shipping. Or someone opened a new box, inserted used cartridges, and took out the new ones.The scanner also does not seem to work.The printing is fine and works. I think the problem is with the company that sold and shipped it to me — something’s amiss here.,It\\'s nice but take time to installation which cause trouble at once after that it\\'s easy to use,Best one for home need!,Got delivered today and I set up using the cable and fired few prints.. Print quality is good. Need to see how long the catridge lasts..but for home purpose and medium usage I think it works,There is some serious issue with the product, it is not working now, need service engineer to repair it. Expect it will last long, price wise it\\'s a good product. Till date it\\'s working well.,One slot got out of order and one using now.value of money and second slot of the charger is average to use.🤪🤪🤪😂😂🇮🇳,Good quality no issues till now working fine with 5v 2ampAs it is 10 watt charger.,Fast charging,Yes it\\'s very nice,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pgVx61I7L._SY88.jpg,Amazing product. Great charging power even two devices  connected with the charger. I charged my pixel 6a and wireless headphone together, both get charged quickly. But issue with the build quality. I once by mistake sat in the charger and the socket end of it broke from the edges and came out completely. I had to fix that with a fevi quick. Now working fine . Overall a very good product. Don\\'t think, just go for it.,It\\'s a good product for this price range. Works fine. Watch is awesome 👌 👏SatisfiedWorking properly,Good,Packaging was very bad,Good,Good Router,Good,Nies,One of the cheapest WiFi 5 gigabit routers. Those not willing to pay 4k rupees or more for WiFi 6 & 6E routers will find this one to be suitable enough. Keep in mind that WiFi 6 & 6E routers will of course have better performance and stability than WiFi 5 routers.Can easily stream 4k videos and download files. No issues on video calls either on phone or PC. No connection drops or any other problems so far.I had to input my ISP-provided account username and password during setup on the miwifi website. Not sure if that will be the case for everybody.Will update in a few more months. Overall it is a good product but it is not worth 300Rs. The price should have been lower.,It\\'s good but not bad. Superb quality product. 👍☺️🤗😊,Before buying this I used spring-based holders and my Samsung and Nokia phones bent due to high pressure, so buy this product blindly. writing it after 4 month of daily usage,I like the colour was fantastic it was easy to input in mobile,Very good adapter to have specially if you are a mobile vlogger. Very stable and feels solid once attached to a tripod. The rubber grips to hold the mobile in the clamp, makes it sturdy and non shakeable. Mobile remains fixed in it\\'s place. The material used is solid too.,worth the price, does the job and is adjuststable as shown in the description. glad i got these at such a reasonable price!,Awesome,I bought it for my iphone 13. Works fine for my phone. I bought this splitter for 120 rupees. I did not find any issue with this product. I am using my wired realme buds 2 earphone and MSI gf63 laptop to test it. My feedbacks:My mic is working properly.No issue with left and right sound.Build quality is also not bad, splitter used flat cable which seems durable.RECOMMENDED 👍,Good product overall. I needed this type of adapter for connecting my mobile headset to my Pc for listening & recording so it\\'s working well on my Pc but only problem is if the earphone jack is inserted fully to the line out socket of Pc (front side), the sound is very low so it needs to be inserted 3/4 only & in that way full maximum sound coming,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61ytYJ9ba7L._SY88.jpg,Good working with boya m1 mike.,When I decided to buy this, I found this with good reviews and Amazon recommended. After using it for many months, there is no disturbance in the quality, both mic and sound.Since I use Laptop and Desktop with same earphone, I need to frequently connect and remove the earphone from the cable, the cable is connected to Desktop, to connect the earphone directly in laptop, having done this so many times there is no issue when it comes to quality.I have recommended this to my colleagues and they also have liked the performance.You can buy this without hesitation.,The headphone jack works well, but when I put the mic jack in the pc, it creates a lot of noise which I am easily able to hear. It causes a bit of irritation sometimes. Elsewise the product is quite good,Great product and really durable.,Good product Grand product,Good quality, but not the best.Best used for backup or archive drives.,I\\'ve been using this since 2021 July and it has been quite a helpful one. I can also put my internal drives and make it external, making it easy for me to access my files, format my drive or use it for some other purposes. And Orico products are really sturdy and well finished products.,Its worth buying the product, very easy to connect the HDD in the case just slide the cover and insert the disk, plug the cable and you are ready.Speed is also very good.,The case is quite good in connectivity and transfer speed but the case body is made up of low quality plastic.It is advisable to go for adata case.,I have been using this for couple of days and I am finally writing a review for this item. It works perfectly fine. I connected my 10 years old laptop hdd through it and I am getting about 75 to 80 MBps (Mega Bytes) read/write speed. Previously I purchased a \"Sata Cable\" which promised USB 3.0 but that did not give me more than 900KBps. So this time I made my choice and got this thing.,It works fine and easy to install. My doubt is with the sturdiness. Will use for few months and update.,Super light and really sturdy its really good product for gamers i would recommend it,Good mouse overall. Price is little high,I have been using this mouse since 2019, and I have to say, logitech built quality is second to none.I have throwed, and bashed this mouse on my table during my gaming sessions, yet this mouse still survives.Even the rubberised grips are still there. Go for it without any hesitation.For those having button issues, I have so far, replaced my left click and middle click button . I started developing these issues after 2 years . It\\'s a simple soldering job to fix it. You can get replacement switches from tanotis. Now they work as good as new.,,So I\\'ve been using this mouse for quite a long time and believe this is the best mouse so far I\\'ve ever used. But the problem is with the cable, as another customer said the cable quality is not good the outer portion of cable from usb and from mouse side coming out and the inside wires can be visible. Even though mouse runs good but this is not good for long term usage. Other than this is pretty good mouse we have.,At close to 150g, it is ridiculously heavy for fast-paced gaming. For chill RPG titles it\\'ll do fine, but if you wanna play something like Apex Legends on this, forget it. The shape of the mouse is super comfortable, only mouse I\\'ve owned that didn\\'t give me any wrist pain even after 4-5 hours continuous usage. Cable quality is what you expect, like it\\'s not even braided. Since, it\\'s an older generation mouse, it doesn\\'t have the double-clicking issue Logitech is infamous for.After all that, I would say in 2022, just don\\'t buy it, it\\'s too old to justify spending any money on.,You know and love Logitech. This is one of their best products.,I\\'d say this is hands down my favorite budget/gaming mouse. It\\'s nice and comfy, works properly, and also has multiple buttons to assign them to various actions, which is not just limited to games, you can assign them to windows actions as well.Have been using this for the last 2 years and I have absolutely no complaints, although my brother thinks that it looks like a beetle :) A good battery set for use with cordless phones. Quick charging, long life.,Nice product. No issue so far. A bit costly compared to other brands,Nice but bit costly compared to other products,Quality is good, indicator is very helpful,Good Charger,Bought the BQ-CC61N version of this. It charges my duracell batteries just fine. Only downside is that it takes a while for full charge(7+ hours) for 900mah AAA duracell batteries. The green led indicator is a little confusing because it does not change colors and the way to know it has finished charging is if the led\\'s turn off. Overall pretty happy with it.,Using wireless mouse so instead of purchasing batteries again and again this is working quite well,Incredible charger, it charges battery very rapidly and battery charging percentage also showing very efficiently.. So I got this keybaord a few days ago and it came in a package that can be best described as being mauled by a bear. It was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough I could just pop it back in no problem. Thankfully it works fine, I tested all the keys and they are functional so let\\'s get to the meat of the subject, or paneer if you\\'re vegetarian:I think this keyboard\\'s performance will vary according to your use case. For me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since I had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. I checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. I bought it along with the Logitech Pebble M350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly I don\\'t regret it. Both of them fir very well into my work type and they\\'ve made my life a lot more easier.This is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasse(I checked). The keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries, and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time. The major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between 3 bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button. Now I personally thought that I wouldn\\'t be using this feature all that much since I was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet. But then I realised that, I could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts, emails on my android tablet at the same time. Nowadays I can\\'t stop using this feature since I have my phone, tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent. It is honestly very neat.The keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than let\\'s say square keys, and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. This comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. Teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion, but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable. It does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images, so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboard.The latency is quite low from my perspective, I don\\'t think they have that crispy Logitech Lightspeed tech built into it though, but you won\\'t be using this for gaming, and if you are planning to then please don\\'t. This keyboard performs horribly in gaming, and I mean it\\'s terrible. This is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind. If I am ambitious enough I can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket, because of how small it is. Like my friends say I have small hands, well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord. Sometimes while I am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything I am doing goes into stasis. But that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard. It does come with arrow keys which is very surprising. They actually managed to squeeze it in.I mean that\\'s pretty much it for this keybaord. Don\\'t buy it for Rs.3k I suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much. I would say this is like a Rs.1.4K keyboard but that\\'s just my opinion. If you are buying this for the android experience then I suggets buying it bunded with the mouse. Because both of them kind of complete each other. With that being said I\\'m going to conclude my review.,Mouse came turned on. Apart from that no issues discovered till now, it going good.,It’s one of the best budget keyboards I have ever used.. the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click… not lift off weight … easy on the fingers … it’s been around 1yr since I bought this keyboard … and Iam using it ever since … no issues so far and Iam highly satisfied with my purchase… definitely gonna recommend it …. Very good typing experience so far,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lIMl3tS4L._SY88.jpg,Cons:No Caps Lock indicatorHeight isn\\'t adjustableNo backlight,The key travel is very very less, please keep that in mind. Otherwise a decent product at the price range.,I bought this in combination with a Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my iPad. It has made my tasks easier and with recent iPadOS updates, there are tons of shortcuts that make iPad experience more productive. Since I was going for a retro-looking device, I chose Sand color. Makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish. Connectivity is fast. You just switch it on and it\\'s connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds, even less. They keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environment.You can connect upto 3 devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button. I\\'m also using the setup for gaming. Will maybe update later about that experience.Final Comments: Ergonomic, economic, portable and lovely! Recommend buy for all who need to get work done fast.,This Keyboard is awesome , It has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability . Just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and I miss the backlight design , but it is a value for money product . Works flawlessly with mac as well as Windows. The Printer is compact and gets the job done. No concerns regarding the time taken or the print quality. The only markdown for this product is the setup. The user manual is brief and doesn\\'t explain how to setup the printer wirelessly or by usb. We spent a good hour having to look through the online manual and you tube videos to understand how this was configured and through trial and error, we managed to get it all ready.,Easy to install,Good print and enough for home usage but installation is quite tedious.,Budget product. Installation was a headache. Did not know if it was done or not. But wireless printing is working somehow. Gets the job done.,The printer is good for personal use. It\\'s working fine till now. It\\'s easy to use. Print quality is also good. Scanning is easy and it\\'s image is fine. Canon Product quality is good to say.,Shipment received in time on 25 th Sept. Due to lack of time i could test the product recently. It is working fine. Wi Fi set up could not perform successfully, i shall try again shortly. Other function are working satisfactory. Only worried is that the cost of its Ink Cartridges.,Printing photo\\'s ar totally not clear,Pros:1) The Best / only wifi all in one printer in the range of 5k with ink saver (so called).2) Low usage required & low maintenance: Thought of buying ink tank but learnt from friends that it\\'s suitable for heavy printing and when they didn\\'t use it for a while repairs needed. Hence decided to go for inkjet with low cost maintenance. This doesn\\'t require daily print like ink tanks.3)  product is solid built and no issues observed so far. Many long term reviews also confirmed flawless working for years so decided this model.4) Print quality: Black is very good but colour is average. Does the job for kids school project purpose.5) Easy setup : It\\'s very easy to setup if you are techy. Setting up WiFi took little bit of time (an hour). I hate reading manuals and it was first time with a printer at home.6) Wi-Fi printing via mobile is a breeze with Canon Selphy app. Easy photo editor by canon is also quite useful /handy.Cons:1) Black is good but Colour is pretty average. Like I said good enough for home /students purpose.2) Not happy with cartidges supplied by Canon. They seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose. It gave around 100 pages for black and 15-20 pages of color with lowest quality settings (where in they claim 250 Black and 100 color). Both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same.2) Ink cartidges cost & yield: The cost cartridges seems to be increasing (when I was purchasing this it was around 500 for black but now it\\'s around 600) and I had no faith on the yield based on what I have got with stock cartidges. It\\'s not worth buying cartidges so go for refill.3) We only find CL 57S Which is small. Where is Cl 57 (large size) ? Couldn\\'t find anywhere online. Good braided cable. Long length. Quick charge. I m using XR. This cable value for money. But chager apple OEM. Portronics type c to lighting  cable worth.,It’s easy to carry and the build quality is quite ok charging speed to almost equal to original oneGiving this review after 1 month usage,Great fit connector, l shaped connectors are convenient and better than some higher priced products.,good,Best product at this price range go for it🔥🔥🔥 and the software shows product will be genuine 🔥 most recommended braided cable for \\uf8ff products,Wish apple made this product as it is easier to hold the phone while charging,Superb quality and supports good charging speeds. Type c to lightning 20w at this price (250Rs) is a steal deal. Nobody is giving this quality at this price,Good cable available at a decent price of Rs. 312.ProsGood design.L shaped connectors will help keeping phone and power bank together in bag or pocket without causing and damage to the charging pins.Does fast charging and compatible with all fast charging power adapters. Purchase time price 1499 i got this head phone. I got re use product in package 1st time but that speakerone side high sound to left side ,so i replace that product 2nd time product box not good but product good after check there are no problem face now i am use 4month  this head phone this is good gaming Pubg, free fire, battle field 5, Gta v,third per shooting game playing my experience good.  please check after buy , one time replace then i got this. and remember offer time buy this product this product price up and down i buy big billion day.,With USB Connector, This headphone is good but not good for Base Music,Headphones are nice and a comfy. Sound is decent and loud. However as it doesn\\'t have it\\'s own volume manager and only controls the systems volume, I have to keep the PC volume to 1% and still have to reduce volumes individually on apps and browser. SO somewhat of an inconvenience for me as I don\\'t listen to things in loud volumes.Mic works fine however it s not exactly adjustable. Solid core surrounded by a spring so you have to bend it but it slowly goes back to an extent and the movement is limited.Cable is covered by very thick coating and seems durable, however, it is not free from interference. If your phone is near the cable you will hear the interference in the headphones.The light on the mic is static and does not indicate the \\'mute\\' status. Can be turned off alongside with other RGB lights on the headphone.You can hear some whine when some software is trying to access the mic and nothing is playing in the headphones.,1. 7.1 is Just Awesome2. The Software Is Very Good3. comfort Is Just Excellent, Not that Good noise cancelling4. I bought it for 1600 and in that price u can\\'t get this type of product5. If u have 2k budget try to get boat im300 it will give better comfort and noise cancellation.,The product is nice. For the price, it has good features. It is a bit heavy tho. The ears heat up easily and you can start sweating easily.,The product is as displayed and is really well built. But the upper part is of metal which adds to it premium-ness makes it heavy. Someone who only uses AirPods or other TWS will find it difficult to adjust. The wire is long and braided and the controller works great too. No need for any external drivers to use the control in mobile devices as well. Works absolutely fine with OTG without compromising noise cancellation.Overall a great deal for ₹1299/-,Early reviewLiked:Looks are greatWire goodSound good bass good treble goodMic level is goodInterface acceptableCan hear sound going from left to right  when enemy runningWorks on my mobile with otg good sound makes me happyDisliked:Fake add that it\\'s 7.1 there was no demo either how it becomes 7.1 like there should be an audio file to demo 7.1 or some sort of test to prove so actually it\\'s just a more organized stereo headset.... But it\\'s OK for this price like many other I know.... Real 7.1 will be Dam expensive and can\\'t be sure how human ear will respond to that technique.... At this stage I am still not convinced that is even possible in the headset anyway...Microphone isnt steady and irritates keeps on going below lip levelMust have Been detachable atleast.please dont search for light in mic as its not in the white model ....one gets  confused upon watching videosPeople complain earpain but they don\\'t understand it isn\\'t heavy or tight but the deep loud bass causes earpain which they don\\'t adjust.Buy it.,Great sound. Great Base. Great quality. I felt llil bit heavy but thats Okay!!. Best product in its range. Product is excellent. But Belkin should check with their sellers as the packaging are worst and also wear and tear signs on the Product package.,Works great no problem so far.the build could have been slightly better,It a Complate surge Protection device, having a circuit to stop surge & Power fluctuations. Go with it without any questions.,Working without any issues from purchased,Must needed surge protector for voltage fluctuations. Brand Belkin proven once again that they are trust worthy.,I have been using Belkin surge socket for aroun 10 years for my desk top system and my tv. Working well. Added one more for another tv,Been using for more than a year. No troubles at all. Great quality,Just go for it. I often use classmates for my daily work which are absolutely brilliant,,Product is good. But,packaging is worst. It was just packed in a thin papar of Amazon. Both the sides were torn completly, monsoon has started and it\\'s common sense that packaging should be done accordingly, and day by day Amazon\\'s packaging becoming worst, I\\'m very unsatisfied with Amazon this time, fortunately products were not damaged. Delivery was good.,Good,It\\'s really helpful for a writing some stuffs on it . Paper quilty are great . And size also fair .  No of pages also fair .,Pages are to good.,At this cost, 3, notebook of Classmate, Amazing,Khata quality is good but expensive than offline market and it takes carrying cost of Rs. 40 as delivery charges from me. Use it for my Macbook pro 13\" and the original is so costly for the same performance.AS for ARTIS service,  I would say that they are EXCELLENT and very customer friendly.  Had issues with my charger about a month after purchase and had exceeded the. return period .  Sought help from them through the warranty registered.They just advised me to send the damaged charger to them and on receipt PROMPTLY sent me a replacement with no other questions asked.  Just the warranty registration and Invoice copy.A very satisfying experience .,It’s almost 4 months purchasing the product now, Doing and last well so far no complaint.,पैसा वसूल,While charging my laptop, this charger gets heated up more than the original charger. That’s my only concern.,im using a 2013 mac book air and this product so far (1.5 months) hasnt diisappointed. Im not  getting the heating issues, as said in the comments , yet. The charging speeds isnt as good as the original one but for quarter the price its okey.,I initially ordered this charger in 2020 during the height of the pandemic as the original apple charger seemed too expensive at rs. 7500.Worked well for 8months before dying and I replaced it within warranty, the replacement was quick and effective. 3 months later, replacement died too, so I ordered a new one. Same story repeated again,for 8 months the original one worked and the replacement worked for 3 months.It is a good charger if you want to use it as an alternative to apple, however remember that it costs 1/4th so it also works for 1/4th the life. Charges the laptop just as well as the original.TLDR : it’s like a yearly subscription based charger, will work well for a year, then you have to order a new one.,Value for money and as far as now it’s working perfectly. Quality wise also not that bad.,The charger is working fine on my macbook 13 inch retina display for the. past 5 months The scan code is too small for configuration. Sometimes two way communication has few echo sound which becomes little irritating. As the title suggests it\\'s a good product but could have been better as it is competing with several brands which are known in the market for their other products.,In night camera won\\'t work.. U nned to on extra light for it.. Only work in day time conditions,value for money,Posting this review after using a week. It is worth buying.Initially faced difficulties in setting the camera and connection establishment.Cable length is about 6 feet.As it mentioned it\\'s rotate 360° perfectly.Motion detection is also perfect.Night vision picture quality is average.Picture quality is good when area is fully illuminated with lights, else overall picture quality is good. Smart tracking works good.You can share this device up to total 06 persons.Two way communication is not so good.Mobile application is also good but use of PAN AND TILT option is taking time to take in effect.Some times Camera missed recording of motion and Human detection.It works only on 2.4GHz network.Ethernet port is given for wired network.To operate this camera you must have strong 2.4 GHz network.It does not work well on mobile data network as it laps frequently and taking time to load live and recording.If you don\\'t have Internet than still camera records, recording stored in SD card.Once you connect the internet, you can explore recordings from SD card. But you can not download.For download in mobile you have to subscribe Imou protect plan, which is expensive.Without Internet it is useless.I think all above points covered to take decision for go with Imou Ranger 2.Overall works as expected.,Nice,Good product in price...,,Mast Previously bought amazon basic USB type A cable and i didn\\'t last long, but this USB C product seems manufactured with high quality materials. Supports fast chagrining, data supply etc. just go for it,Exllent,Very satisfied with this purchase, just like orginal quality . Will buy again in future .,My sister is using this cable to charge her phone and the cable is durable and good enough for my sister\\'s phone. Love it!!,I bought it to use Android Auto on Tata Altroz car by connecting to my one plus nord 2T mobile.I have been using this for more than a week now. It\\'s working perfectly..I am happy with the product so far.,Basic,Great product money worth,No issues Recieved a wrong color.. But ok..,Simple and Quick solution for some night time study session.🤗 Bought it for 34 Rupees cuz I didn\\'t wanna pay the 80🤨 Rs. shipping on my order of 466.🤣,Fair product,go for it. use it carefully while plugging in,Super,Purchased 2 pieces.  Kept one in my travel bag and use it during my travels to rural areas. I fix it to my power bank during  power cuts. The other one is in the car.,Good product,Value for money first i would like to comment on the tab market of India. the most peculiar thing I have seen in India is, when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible. it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the USA. you watch the prices of chromebooks, tablets, back to school offers in the US and compare them to India and it feels extremely unbalanced. after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier 1 brands started delivering garbage for 20000 rupees. snapdragon 400, old mediatek, 4gb ram, abysmal non ips screen for 20k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students. THIS TABLET BRINGS THE REVOLUTION.I am no student, but bought this for day to day use and I am an user of the normal big bezel 7th gen iPad, so my review will be comparative in nature. also i bought this at 23000 rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price I paid.1. if you are planning to buy an iPad, just buy it considering 64gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios. you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updates.this tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad FOR 23K RUPEES. even for 27k it is fine.2. build is fine although I put a tempered glass on the 1st day itself. back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy.3. the IPS screen is really good, there is no backlight bleeding, no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background. I am used to OLED screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but OLED is impossible at this price. the screen is better than my 7th gen iPad\\'s display. it is brighter, has more punchy colours, blacks are darker. on top of that 120hz panel, hdr certification, dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption. it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it. display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet.4. snapdragon 860 is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market. hence I say if you don\\'t want this just buy an iPad but don\\'t buy any other android tablet at 20-30k price point. all are trash. 860 was fine with all those games which rule the market today. it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless.5. i can\\'t comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i don\\'t see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming. it has a 22.5 watt charger in the box although it does support 33 watt charging. the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my iPad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers.6. the camera is okayish, just like most tablet cameras. the iPad has even worse cameras. for document  scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful. it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in 25k range tablets.7. the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers. they are loud, have depth, are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage. they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost 40-50k. they will hit you as a massive surprise. i did not at all expect such good speakers. they seriously outmatch those cheapo 700Rs boat, goat, mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes, separation and low end. of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantity.coming to the cons-1. was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldn\\'t find a place for a 3.5mm jack. not even a dongle in the box. they should seriously stop copying apple\\'s wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates. although I mitigated the issue by using portable dongle DACs like shanling ua1, ibasso dc03.....etc which i generally use with even my phones and my PC coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some LG phones with quad dac. i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not. although it works with my old MI A2 dongle just fine.2. for 23000 rupees I don\\'t expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with 23k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as Indian tablet market and its offerings but for 27k they could just offer a bundle where you pay 1k-2k rupees more and get the pen as an add on.3. the accessory market might not be that vibrant. already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands. there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at 5000 rupees LOL. the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i don\\'t trust those type of cases.one more issue that I would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by 500-1000 rupees within a month or two by doing the good old \"GST BRO\". so if it ever reaches 28-29k for the 128gb version just close your eyes and buy an iPad with card discounts.so, in a nut shell for 23K it is was no brainer, but even for 27K it is a really good deal considering what its competitors are.hope this was helpful.,I have been using the Mi Pad 5 for over a month now, and am only glad that I didn\\'t spend more on an iPad. Once the retail-therapy phase of the device wears off, what remains is the user experience. While it is true for both devices, I find that I\\'m more at ease with the Mi pad 5 for the sheer look and feel of the content I watch in it. I also spend a lot of time reading books and illustrated designs (PDFs) and I often found myself amazed (almost chuffed) over how good the content looked. That display gets the accolades for a reason.The Mi Pad 5 largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet, the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the iPad (a gross generalisation). So, here\\'s my take on Apple\\'s iPad (9th Gen) vs. Xiaomi Pad 5If you have an Apple device already, and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet, you need to stick to the iPad. Not just because it is going to regulate the standard, but you will definitely miss out on the features that eco-system offers.So, buy the iPad if you:are not concerned about the price-tagare looking at designing with the Apple pencil and are familiar with, or going to use ProCreateare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for a new tablet anytime soon.intend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave a clear purpose for the \\'Sidecar\\' feature - if you don\\'t use it despite buying the iPad, you are missing out!engage in a lot of official video-conferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame. The iPad has a feature that addresses this to an extent.are not expecting substantially higher results than the Mi Pad 5 from the in-built camera in general.have a proclivity towards the Apple design, their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices Apple makes for you.don\\'t really care about features beyond a rigid list of activities you are certain the iPad is able to do; and that this list is unlikely to change in the near future.looking for a reliable product that will receive Software support for a long period of time.are expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave a need to use touch IDOn the other hand, buy the Mi pad 5 if you:are looking at gaming on a plethora of titles that are on the Google PlayStore and perhaps not found elsewheredon\\'t care much about the stock iOS cookie-cutter experience and think customization is the only way you\\'ll truly be happy with the tablet you use.want the best quality of video and photo capture from a tablet - meaning better video calls and video capture. This doesn\\'t mean the camera will replace the phone you already have, but the Pad 5 is a tool that goes the extra-mile of taking good quality images, scanning documents and allows edits on its large screen.value video-quality from the Mi Pad camera than the AI that drives the face-tracking function iPad offers.want the most of the audio experience, higher audio quality, clarity and richness.are expecting rich colour depth, HDR quality video experience and will be spending more than 50% of your time on the tablet watching videos.don\\'t like limitations imposed on you, as with the software you use (sideload APKs), rooting, Custom Firmware, overclocking, etc. If you do any or all of these, forget about the iPad.are mostly going to use it as a fun device to watch movies on or consume audio-visual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and a leg (comparatively) to fix a broken screen or a damaged back panel.are okay without a fingerprint scanner and is okay with FaceID, PIN or Pattern for security.At the end of the day, you as a user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device; not the logo at the back.,The tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches I have contact to Xiaomi  they will try to fix it. One req don\\'t upgraded after you buy don\\'t have to do 13.0.6 . After the update not a single Google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many Black patches around the bar white bar sometimes. nice tablet you can go with it. And if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word Excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and I am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for Android l because Android 12l is good for tablet.New update is here.So the new Android 12 update is here unfortunately is not Android 12 l but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but it\\'s totally refined from the past and system is working great 120 hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than 10 hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily 2 to 3 days because I am doing PPT Excel sheet and other documentation it\\'s work totally fine and yeah that\\'s the new update and go for xiaomi back 5. About pencilSo I bought xiaomi pencil for 6000 and if I say latency has been improved but if if you don\\'t have the budget of 6000 go for another shopping site which name after f cart yeah🙂 and you can buy it\\'s f(smart buy) pencil for 1500 rupees it works fine too and you don\\'t have to spend 6000 you can go with the 1500 just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note down..,over all i am satisfied with this tablet, For those looking for a genuine review & a brief comparison summary between the best three earphones/headphones in the budget segment ...Let\\'s help you to make-up your mind. The review is for Sennheiser 275 S earphone but items for comparison are:1.) Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone ,2.) Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone3.) Sony MDR-XB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones  Just for an introduction i would like to mention, I am a dire fan for flagship Electronic goods & manages to fulfill my passion for the \"Taste of quality\" from time to time. Now let’s begin.. When you start looking for earphones or headphones, Sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so, The brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment .I too ,started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power & excluding those insanely pricey ones.Read some very good reviews of the Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Over-Ear Headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought it.Found it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks( may refer my review of HD202 at amazon) which were not upto my taste.Next ,Unsettled , I went to purchase these Sennheiiser CX 275 S in earphones and here are my observations:DESIGN  & CONSTRUCTION :×××××××××××××××××××××××××a.) Looks & feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently, then in the long run,its sure to fail.b.) Wires which are around 1.2 m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use it.c.) Comes with 3 different sized earpieces to snug fit different ear-anatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the best.d.) Inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fit.e.) Comes with a gold plated L-shaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf.) Comes with a small pouch , which for the most part was a useless accessory for me. A case or box would have been more a more elegant option. Squeezing the whole earphone into the li\\'ll pouch everytime..naah !! feels primitive..! but then its my own two pieces.SOUND QUALITY & PERFORMANCE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe sound quality is crisp & clear , with clear mids and crisp pitches, bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug it-in to watch some movie or NATGEO documentaries.The lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimes.The frequency response as per specs was 17 to 23000 Hz against 4 to 24000 Hz of Sony MDR-XB50AP.Just to quote Sony’s bass could get really deep & low with its 12mm drivers and neodymium magnets. For purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony “A little make-up won’t Hurt ”  LOL.Sound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apex.VERDICT :xxxxxxxxxxxxxx* Lack of a decent bass & extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of 1600 bucks *For me \"Not worth it\".DETAILS & COMPARISON :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI happened to test the quality & performance of all the 3 renowned Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone, Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone & lastly Sony MDR-XB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones.BASS :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxSony>>Senn.HD 202 > Senn.CX 275S ,The extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels Cheap, redundant or unpleasant to the ears. It’s a quality refined timbre  bass & not some low quality stuff. HD 202 bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing others.SOUND QUALITY :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxExcellent on all 3 but Sony a bit appealing with its  phenomenal immersive bass.BUILD & DESIGN :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Again Sony>>Senn.HD 202 > Senn.CX 275S .Sony’s wire were tangle free, earphone pieces felt indestructible, noise isolation was “Ultimate”.Next was Senn.HD 202 and least by any standards was Senn.CX 275S.The fragile design of the wires around Mic. In senn.CX 275 may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many.1.) Senn.HD 202 II might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issue.Bass is anytime better than Senn.CX 275 S but not as mesmerising as Sony.Sound quality though is very good,crisp and clear.2.) Senn.CX 275 S might be good for purists but even with its balanced Highs and mids..Serious lack of bass keeps you longing for more ..especially if you are more into movies,games and documentaries than music.Moreover its extremely fragile & always tangling thin wires  is a constant annoying feature.3.) Sony MDR XB50AP gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality mids.Its indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wires.**Do not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure music.Its a quality bass with frequency response as low as 4 to 24000 Hz.adds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other two.Probably like a Super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy & full of life.Anyways at the end of the day its your call.keep listening.,NOTE:@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,BUILT QUALITY :------------------● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.Connector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●COMFORT :------------● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●LOUDNESS :-------------CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :---------------------------------------------I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :----------------------------------● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :PNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●CONNECTIVITY :------------------All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.VERDICT :----------I don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision. Quality is good but ..rubber is missing in one of the leg of the alptop stand,Good product, strong and sturdy. Price can be little less around 250-300.,I bought it with that in mindThat thought was fulfilled.,Height adjustable is not equal and perfect.,Its very useful and value for money,Affordable adjustable stand for laptops. It is really light and doesn\\'t occupy much space. Easy to carry. Stand is stable in flat surfaces. Simple to fold and unfold. Good to buy this product.,fabulous product,A good one, must buy, value for money It worked well for some days later it is not working , I want it to replace.,Nice,Superb product with white lights at both ends when charging. colour and quality feels very premium..,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/81u-AB650VL._SY88.jpg,Good,Good Build Quality. Nice Product & Highly Recommended.,Good quality and looks beautiful... I will surely recommend,( After using it for 3 weeks). I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasn\\'t able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 20-90%. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour. Overall, I\\'m very happy with the product.I highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging Type C to C cable.Will update this review if any change is observed. It was what I expected.  Does the job.,Recommended.,Nice quality and durable,It is exact same volt and watt as my old charger is.,Best product in this price and overall ok,100% Original,Quality assurance,Decent performance Value for money,Good 👍,The mobile/tab stand is a well made product. Tilt and height adjustment are a great pluses. Sturdy enough for 8/10\" tabs. Can be used on a flat surface like table top, not top of my bed!.,Have been using this for almost 6 months now, no issues faced till date, i have bought both black and white one\\'s, but white variants quality is better than the black one,Not durable, durability is required,Ordered this since i liked the simplicity of this product.Was little disappointed when i received this because of the following reasons :1. had scratches on it, probably someone returned this earlier, and it was fixed and sent to me.2. The screws are little loose, hence reduced a star.3. When closed, can see gap, so is not so perfect.In the end, decided to accept the flaws and keep it rather than getting it replaced ( didn\\'t want to go through the process) since the flaws are not so bad.,No screwto hold top part stable,utility product for mobile tab etc I have lot of cables running between my Soundsystem, Settop box, TV and between my routers, accesspoint. It was kind of messy before. I organized it using insulated thin metal tie cable. But when i open it to add more cables or remove cable, it was broken and not looks good. Also i was afraid that tightening the tie cable may cur the wire since it was so thin and insulation is also very thin. But after i use this, it looks so neat and it is easy to remove or add more cable whenever required. adhesion of wellgrow is good.Overall, i like this productI suggest dont to precisely cut the wellgrow. Add some 50-70% of extra length which will allow to add more cables in future if needed,All was good, but I received 6 pieces instead of 7. Since I have used 1 already, I\\'m not going to return it. Just requesting the sellers to deliver as promised. Other than that, the2 product is great, and works great.,Not only WFH setup, but also if you\\'re dealing with a lot of wires, this is the way to go.,Good quality,Good quantity and quality, sticks tightly and easy to strap. Helpful for keeping wires organized at work table  (laptop charger , mobile charges etc),I had to bind together variable number of wires at different places and this worked great without any wastage.,Useful to organize wire . Little expensive but I don\\'t have time to find it in my locality and quality is also good.,These are strong and better than plastic tags which you normally use to keep wires in order. These can be removed and reused. They are also very strong as they are supporting my bluetooth soundbar which I have hung up in my room. Liked the product.  Accurate to my usb apparatus.,Good value,Till now i had purchased about 20 cables both micro and c type for myself and my family in this last one year. Its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price,na,tested with 2.4 amps charger and phone. gives full 2.4 amps power to phone.the cable LOOKS thick and it has nice texture. despite that, i am sure it is not very durable. the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex. the wire will break before the connector does!!warning: usb micro connector has a strong hook. be careful while plugging and unplugging, or you may damage your device.very cheap and usable cable for 120 rs,Super power,Nice product.,In this price this is the best one Good product, can go for it,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/711qovROcIL._SY88.jpg,Brought it for my 3 years old nephew, he is just in love with these camel colours.,Good to use and handling color with boc,I purchased this for my 5 year old who does not like to stop drawing. The range of colours covers all tones desirable. She has been in love with it since the day it arrived.I couldn\\'t resist myself from using this set (of course, when she was away😃). The colours are smooth and bright, blends very well. It is good for any types of portraits, even those with bold colours.,Easy to use,Good product but easily breaking in pieces when applying more pressure,Good Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand\\'s inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you\\'re conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I\\'m using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I\\'ve been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. 👍🏻,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it\\'s super product and 3 year\\'s of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one. This wire has a good build quality and can do 65 watts (6.5a). it has a good grip and a good handling, smooth chalta hain aur speed changing button se mast se speed change hoti hain. only thing i am worried is that the cord will damage with wear and tear.,Very awesome and smooth to use, very helpful while gaming .,Good,Looking for gaming 😏,Actualy performance is awesome ..but its build quality is very worst .. plastic which is use in left and right click buttons has highly chance of breaking.... So this product not satisfied me,Nice gaming Mouse from HP in the price range. Thank you Amazon for the fast delivery.,,👍🤗 Product is good, print quality is good,Super printing,Like,Good prospect I am recommending,I USED FOR 20 DAYS BUT I DONT KNOW AFTER THAT WILL PARFORMANCE,Nice product,Good,SATISFACTORY As per expectations,At this price point, guide stickers should be provided. Installation without those guide stickers is challenging for lay person. I ended up having to lift up the sticker several times to realign in and this resulted in imperfections in few places and so now there are bubles that I can\\'t do anything about.,Suits correctly. Good quality for money,Ok,Liked the product and packaging was very impressive,Quality-wise and usage-wise the glass is fine but the alignments are not proper for my tablet.In Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 (2022), the glass alignment (centering) nearby the front camera is not proper (refer to my pictures uploaded).Rest is fine.,Perfect fi. No bubble or smudge but the price is a bit on higher side. Otherwise OK.,Good Good product,Stability: okSturdiness: mediumMaterial: aluminiumOverall quality: FairDoes the job!,Need to have more  holder to keep the nBook more steady,Does the job but a bit wobbly for bigger laptops,Metal built.. A handy piece of equipment, if you want to improve your laptop\\'s air flow as well as your back posture.,Its just OK.,Nice product,Costly but as per product description. You might get very cheaper in local market Product is good , and also it\\'s  strudiness .But no fast charging in this cable , it\\'s normally charging . I love it because it\\'s supported in micro usb , or type c . Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it\\'s okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel. I need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank. Will recommend.,Best cable,good,Both Micro USB & Type C mobile connector\\'s are getting charge.Good Decision to purchase this product.,Cable is a good fibre braided with good length.The connector also has a tight fit, sometimes you have to apply a bit force to remove(ig it\\'ll wear off after usage).In comparison, boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pin.,I like the product bcuz it\\'s help me to charge both phone Type C & Micro Cabel After 1 month of use  i can say that this is best device for Lenovo laptop. Easy to use,Highly recommended this good product,Works well,Very good,Used it for more than 3 months. No complaints so far. Great mouse for daily office use.,The Mouse is working perfectly, and I thing best one as per the budget.,Battery used more if not use it should auto off required,I used it for my office work, didn\\'t find any issue, size Is OK, connectivity is good, sensor works fine.. You can go for it Everything is fine but it is bulky and hard, it should be softer and thinner.....,Thank you  Amazon very good charging cable 👍,Good,Good one,quality is good. worth for 150-200 ₹. short but durable.,Very Good product . Satisfied..,This is fast charging C pin USB!You can purchase it.,Nice product at price of below 100 Bahut aacha hai ye pen sach me likhne ke Baad erase ho jata hai, so nice... 😍💫,I had bought 5 of these and they are excellent pens for the price but even after waiting for the ink to dry so I can erase the ink properly, it still left a stain and also after keeping my notebook at room temperature it started show the ink in a light blue colour which was not very noticeable hence I am giving this product 4 stars. Also, I like collecting a lot of stationery from Japanese manufacturers and this was not as good as I expected so I would rather buy a Uni-Ball Air or a Signo or a Sarasa. Not expecting so much compromise from a brand like Pilot, whose V-Sign is placed at the same price and definitely did not have any quality compromise whatsoever. Anyway, if you want a starter pen take the V7 or something.,My current go-to pen. Highly recommend if you\\'re someone who happens to do a lot of scribbling while writing an exam paper. Really great for annotating stuff which you can erase and correct as and when needed,The pen really erases but; the ink finshed just in a week½; so not to use this pen if you are a student like me.,You need to apply more force and move your hand fast to erase what you wrote,It\\'s a very nice pen, writes very smooth, comparable to a pentel energel gel pen, grip is comfy, it has a nice click sound when retracted, the eraser part gets dirty with oils n dirt sometimes, which when erasing with leaves a faint brown stain due to the oil n dirt, just wipe it with some cloth like your shirt and you\\'ll be fine. Wish refills were easily accessible though.,Best for neat homework if your kid makes lot of spelling mistakes. Slightly expensive. Occasionally found dry ink.,Easy to use, write only on paper not elsewhere value for money Its really good,Best stand from others in price,in stability and in branding & look,I work with both a big screen and laptop side by side. By using this, i can bring up the laptop screen to the same level as the Big screen which actually reduced my neck pain.It\\'s really sturdy & light weight as well.,A very good product, using it since a while now maybe close to a year.very portable this is practically something in my laptop bag.The slotted angles are very good and pretty convenient and comfortable to use the laptop in.I also use it for my ipad, and this works like a charm.,I like the build quality. It is good, it is sturdy, it is light weight, and came with a good pouch to carry.One area of improvement - you always need both the hands to adjust the height with laptop off. And if you are moving it, the level of height / adjustment will collapse. I would have liked if the height was lockable so that if you are moving the stand will not collapse.,The produt is good,value for money,Its better you get a wooden one.Its hard to adjust, feels cheap quality.If you have requirement to move it around, don\\'t buy this. If you get some offer and would not be moving this around much. Good thing to be placed in the corner. Keyboard is good. I don\\'t really like that clicking sound of mechanical keyboard as I am a software developer and write codes most of the time. Some times that mechanical sound really irritiates, and sometimes seems stressing out my fingers. This keyboard is good. Works as I wanted it to be. But the real issue is, while I am digging my code with mouse, keyboard light goes off and I need to click CAPS or NUM key to lit it again. Its not an issue for average user, but irritates me as I sometime forget to turn on NUM lock and while typing number in my code, I accidentally change edit mode to INSERT (due to 0 pressed). Otherwise all seems OK. I wish HP had offered Always ON option for this keyboard.,If there is any wrist support this product will skyrocket in its price range,A good product for this price range ,  RGB light is elegant and good quality keys and its built.....!!,Smooth keystrokes.Uneven distribution of the backlight over the font causing hard to read keys. Only time when all keys are properly readable is when you look at it directly at a perpendicular angle. Since I don\\'t need to look at the letters for normal everyday typing, I can get away with it.There are no indication in the keyboard for the FN + function key combos. Usually in other keyboard there are symbols in the function keys to indicate what they do when pressed with FN.Overall it seems to be acceptable!,Good and value for money,The silver coating came off after 3days.,Does the purpose of back-lit and typing. For typing not that great. Buy keyboards that are less mechanical for that. This is good buy doesn\\'t give the ease of typing style as in a laptop,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NiWbc0NvL._SY88.jpg it\\'s quality is really good and it can carry 15.6\" to 16\" laptops easily 👍,No problem to take.  Must be taken.  The quality is great.  The stitching is also strong,The stitching is very ordinary and it looks bad on the inner side.,Decent purchase,The product does not have zip and preferred to use black side.The red side gets fluffy.Measures are 11.2 to 15.6 inch.Your laptop should be smaller then this size.So that it fits and easy to remove.,Fit perfectly for laptop material is good not best but within this price it is really good bit expensive could have been under 100 rupees ( justified) works well prevents from dust undoubtedly one should go for it,Product looks good,Big size want small size very good product, very bright, easy to use, it worked properly for almost one year.,ok,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71v4DhpLpeL._SY88.jpg,Nice & useful.,For defective I guess. One or two LED not illuminating properly.,Just ok,Length is very short,It\\'s brightness is Good, but it\\'s light panel is too hot after use some time. No complaints till now. Only cons is 1st time connection is Lil messy. Once it connected no need to look back,Value for money (bought it for around 1300/- on sale), quick & easy to install & good coverage.,,bought this as wifi was not working in my room due to placement of router. was very doubtful to buy as it was pricey as per my view but once you buy you can take it with you when you move or shift so it\\'s a forever product. strength of wifi is so good now i can watch lectures. just install app. you can also add or remove people  who uses it. very manageable.,I bought this as a backup extender. Setting it up was a breeze but I faced a silly self-inflicted issue. I entered wrong WiFi password during setup but setup completed as if the connection to the router was successful. When I tried to browse, it showed \"no internet\" connection between the extender and the router. It took me some time to troubleshoot and correct the password. Ideally, the setup process should have highlighted the error and stopped the setup process showing the connection to the router was not successful, it would have saved me some headache to troubleshoot.Extender Coverage:I use the extender to reach a corner of the house about 45ft away from the router where I get sporadic and weak signal (5MBPS). I locate the extender about 30ft away from the router to extend the network and now I get a connection of 20MBPS. It is enough for my work.Speed Test Results:> At the time of testing, my laptop recorded a speed of 90MBPS next to the router.> At the point where I located the extender (30ft away), when directly connected to the router, the laptop recorded a speed of 30MBPS .> At the same point when connected to the extender, the laptop recorded a speed of 27MBPS, only 10% drop (not so bad). 15 feet away from the extender without direct line of sight, the laptop recorded 21MBPS+.Overall, I am satisfied with its performance.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613f3cGFTwL._SY88.jpg,Good for home use but its Range is like till one room only it can extend, not much, but good one, like my router is in middle passage in my home but its range doesnt come out much without extender , when i started using extender it pulls the Range till this specific room, if your room is one after the other then it wont go till last room .,Extends my wifi signals and does it job very effectively.  Once concern is i have 5g actfiber signal but this gives 2.5 hz only but still managable for tv laptop mobiles etc for home purpose. The LED light is vibrant with multiple form selection, Buildup is too good, Feels strong and wont get damaged even if it was to fall from table height. The battery life is too good if used without LEDs. With LEDs it will last around 2.5 to 3 hours only. Without LED more than 5 hours for sure. Dont expect too much bass and overal sound quality is good for what one is paying. Justifies he price. Initially I was using JBL GO (version 1) but surely I can say JBL was way too better with bass than this one but obviously JBL wa double the price. Go for it if u want a desent sound quality with fancy led lights. overall 4 star.PS- The size is actually larger that what it feels in the pictures.,It\\'s good for home purpose kids to entertain music and light effect but not for party or something like that,Such a best product at this price but little disappointed as in photos and description they said memory card slot is there but when I get this product, memory card slot was not there but still I like this product and specially lighting effect and good bass sound,Sound is no doubt good.bluetooth range is short... battery life is not up to the mark.Led light is too good.,I would have rated it 5 star but 1 sudden night it really made a chaos! It was uncontrollable, not switching off, made horrific noise out of the blue. I kept it outside whole night so that the battery drained out and next day it was functional. I think that was a software glitch, anyway it didn\\'t appear again for sake!,Good but battery drain pretty fast...,Volume is less,Nice products Packing is good .. they have sent a box for itAlso the quality looks good and decently fast chargingGood product for the price paid,Nice product,nice charging cable for low cost.,Highly recommended,Quite nice cable in this price, charging my iPad smoothly  Go for it,I like the product and resnable precise.,Worth buyinh,Nice You can use android & ISO devices.,Mouse is very good but bluetooth option can\\'t support in macbook pro,Update 3: I have received the replacement mouse for the replacement mouse. It seems to work fine till date. Sometimes it hangs and I have to restart it but compared to previous ones it is fine. Not 100% reliable but the customer service and replacement has been good. Would recommend the product if you have a backup mouse with you as it is not completely reliable.Update 2: The replacement mouse broke within 2 days. It stopped working completely and the mouse cursor doesn\\'t even move. Asked for a refund but they are sending me another mouse after testing it for a week. I am losing hope.Update 1: I contacted their WhatsApp customer service number, they arranged for a replacement immediately and I received it after a week. I had to use an old mouse in the mean time.I used to trust offbeat products but I am greatly disappointed as this mouse broke just after two weeks. The mouse pointer moves erratically on it\\'s own. The return window closed two days ago and I can\\'t return this broken garbage. I will file a complaint to consumer court if I am not refunded.,Good,I use apple\\'s magic mouse regularly which is a superior one for obvious reasons (stylist design, it supports gestures, battery backup is unparallel).This offbeat mouse is almost as per in terms of ergonomics and design.We can not expect this mouse to support gestures (at this price point and innovation) but does the job well. The good part is, you have dual modes of connecting, dongle and Bluetooth. Decorative lights are a plus.  I tested this mouse connecting to MacBook and works all well.For battery and charging, I am not able to comment yet as not used for long term.Overall a happy buy.... :),Good battery life, Adjustable DPI works well, easy to use & switch devices, Bluetooth is sorted, RGB has low illumination. Basic everyday use Bluetooth mice.,It\\'s a good productUsing it since 6 monthsHappy with the battery life.Quality could\\'ve been better.,No issues so far and quality is good. Liked the design too. Good for learning drawing for kids. MRP of product is 120 (4 books , 30 a piece)  but amazon charged 140 initially. Contacted customer service and got the difference in amount back.,Great work experience.....,Valuable,Good product at affordable rate,Nice will order again,Very good deal,Paper texture is good. Best at this price,My kids like the drawing books n it\\'s value for money At the sub 2000 INR price range, I was doubtful to buy a mechanical keyboard as there are a lot of disappointing pseudo mechanical keyboards available at this range. I already had a logitech G213 prodigy which was great with it\\'s membrane so I almost thought of not buying it. But after much thought I bought it. It turns out to be amazing. It has a key cap remover included which is a great bonus. Each click feels responsive and great, I am typing 15+ wpm with this compared to my G213. The size is a bit small for a full sized keyboard and the RGB is somewhat painful. But other than that , it is the best keyboard in this price range.,Good keyboard for people who loves typing sound 😊,Nice product, Very Good Build quality, price of Rs.1500/- is justified. and i have written the review using the same key board.,Best budget friendly,A very good keyboard to begin your mechanical keyboard journey with. This is much better than any membrane keyboard you will ever use.Been using for more than 1 year and still working fine, although the blue switches slowly lose their crisp sound but that is expected from this brand of switches.,Value for money, I wish i could coustomise to colour of RGB  but rest it\\'s very good.,Very good product 👌 and perfectly working well,Hello guys today I am going to tell you about HP GK 320 gaming keyboard so it cost me around 1700 and I give the ratings from 5 star I will give it three star because it have some RGB issues and I recommend you only buy this keyboard if you get it under 2000 if it cost over 2000 I recommend that don\\'t buy this keyboard ,Writes smoothly,Nice,The look and feel of the pen is amazing, being a Parker its extremely smooth. But the lid of the pen case is broken so it would be embarassing if you are gifting it to someone and they find it broken.,Nice,Very nice pen but not ball pen jel pen,,Its the best parker pen 🤩I have every used and it have came my 😲main😲parker pen I have 10 to 15 pens of parker😅🤪 but this is my main pen now😁 don\\'t think twice just go with it 😃😁its the best pen pls buy 😏if get a chance😏 . Very good Amazon😄 First of All Delivery of Amazon: It was as specified no delays. Hence, appreciate it.Packaging: Not Good. The box was tempered, torn and damaged.Product: Ordered Black, received brown. Didn’t replace as the Color didn’t much mattered. Issue is with the seller though.Performance: The pen of good. Robust, feels cheap however, looking at the price not to complain. Writes smooth.For anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens, can start with this as it does the job.Edited: Have been using this pen for over 3 days now, I am facing issue of nib dryness. If I don’t use the pen for sometime. The pen doesn’t write at all. I have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing. It writes great when it starts writing. But the initial pick up is really bad. I have a platinum preppy too. It’s a better option to go with if the budget is tight. However, there we have good writing but bad looks.,Few points I have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer. (Compared with two other pens- Parker Vector and Luxor V5)1. Grip  Read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the \"curve\" at the grip which makes it awkward to hold. Honestly, have not felt so at all. The grip is pretty medium, larger than Parker Vector and comparable to the Luxor V5. It wont create any problems holding it. I am an average 5\\'10 and people of same build, hand and finger size wont be any problem. Also on Parker Vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal, small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages. Been nice to hold the Elegante and feel firm in hand, it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance :) .2. Nib and feeder:  It says Fine on the nib and it is comparable to the Luxor V5 0.5 and Parker Fine nib. Few claim it is 0.7 / medium kinds. Its all about the pressure on puts when writing it. I just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does, so would say- it is Fine. It is way too smoooooother and fluent than Parker which felt a bit rough. Parker Fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience. However on Elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper. It is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides. The feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience. The writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry, personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging. This ensures that one gets to write about 6 pages i.e 12 sides without a refill.3.  Plastic construction and feel in hand:  The cap is made of brass(as they say). The cap has a \"matte\" finish, not a glossy one. The clip and top is glossy. Gives a fair enough good contrast to add some \"looks\" to it when taking it out of the pocket :D . The pen itself- very much plastic. If I try to weigh both the cap and pen separately, roughly they feel of same weight, it is that light weight ( just a feel factor how I felt). However this does not mean it is a cheap construction. It has fallen from 2 floors down and did not crack anywhere, so would say its good strong plastic. It makes one feel pretty solid holding it. The size if compared to other two is larger. It rests pretty well in between my thumb and index finger(which parker does not, Luxor does) , hence never needed to put the clip on the rear. Without the clip it is very much balanced (Parker and Luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top) , with clip Elegante and Parker feel a bit -top heavy.4. Ink filling:  Personally always been a fan of eyedroppers(good old school days) , however this comes with the standard piston filling( as seen in the photo by Hari). When I immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half. Had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled. In parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient. For Luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious. Some other reviews I read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper!!! Few said it worked , few said it leaked. Need to substantiate it. Not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece. If anyone has tried would love to hear your experience.5. Writing after 3 weeks:  For Luxor, it works immediately! Even after 6 months it worked like magic. For Parker bit of dipping, or couple of splashing out and it starts. For Elegante it did not start immediately. From school days used to have an Airmail (unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted) it used to work like a beauty even after 3 weeks. Elegante on this aspect did not fair so well. However, how many of us are not going to use their Pen for 3 weeks, always something to write, sign or pen down :) . It worked fairly after a break of one week.6. Colour:  Personally the \"looks\" of a pen hardly matter to me. Its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul. We pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks. For few people this matters more- individual choice and nothing against it.  Parker gives a good classy look, Luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive. Elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both. Neither a college going look nor an Executive look. On looks it does fair enough justice- The cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart. Would have loved if they would have made more colours than Maroon, Black and Blue. Nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what Reynolds have- bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them. This does enough for me.7. Spare Nibs and feeder:  Not sure if there are spare nibs available online. I am at a location which is 100s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online (thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers :lticaptd: ) . After using this nib, I would personally not place any other nib. I am pretty happy about it. (always good habit to have spare nibs, dont know when one drops it and needs to change).8. Recommended for:  Its a must for student. At this price range where one is still studying and not earning, this sounds a good buy, though not the best as Luxor beats this is VFM. Parker, would never recommend it for students. If someone wants to carry it for exams- carry 2 atleast, all due to the limited piston converter capacity. Luxor- would be best. If you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives. This is fair on looks and pleasure for writing :)  :)  :) .9. Value for Money:  For a standard person like me or a student, Luxor beats Elegante and Parker. However for a fountain pen- This is an excellent VFM :)Well, this sums up my experience after using it. Anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it,★ First of all, it came in a really bad condition. The package was almost flattened. All thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery. Thank God it doesn\\'t have any dent.★ Secondly, it is probably a used product. Because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box.★ Thirdly, the brand claims that it is having a fine nib, but probably according to the European standards. I am a Pilot lover, so I know what fine nib is. This is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of Pilot. Using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm. You remember the experience for a long time. The handwriting also becomes better. That\\'s lacking in this pen.* Thankfully it doesn\\'t squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens. I had two Wingsungs. Those were unbearably squirty.★ Fourthly, the grip is average.★ Fifthly, if you are a beginner, you may go for it, as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens. You may use it as a day to day pen.BUT DON\\'T STICK WITH THIS ONE ONLY. EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PILOT IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET. TRUST ME, YOU WON\\'T LOOK BACK TO A PEN LIKE THIS. I WAS GIFTED A PILOT CROCODILE FINE NIB BY MY MOM. I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORIES WITH THIS PEN SAFE. SO I DON\\'T USUALLY USE THAT. THAT\\'S WHY I\\'VE BOUGHT THIS ONE.★ Lastly and most importantly, a suggestion to the buyers, to make your pen experience ergonomic, please don\\'t put the cap on the backside. Open the cap, keep it aside and unleash your writing...,very nice pen., it\\'s really amazing very smooth writing.thank you seller & amazon.,Its not for speedy writing, if you are use for signature its cutting off character,...., Some time spread over ink. And some time character cutting.... Cheap plastic product but at a 200 good for beginners.,I\\'ve been using this pen for about 3monthspros:Build quality for this price is amazinggold Nib looks amazingcons:Nib comes out easily,Just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to ..,Guys I have started using fountain pens again a few months back. I had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like COLLEGE brand eye droppers, Camlin, Parker (made in USA), Hero (China made). Recently I am using Platinum Preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is Japan made. This the Camlin Elegante is our very own Made in India pen. It makes us proud. Just superb pen. Very smooth. It is actually a no nonsense pen. Only thing...since I had read a few negative reviews about this...I am using it with PILOT BLUE ink. I don\\'t know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what? Whatever it may be.....This pen with Pilot ink combination rocks...just superb experience of writing with THE FOUNTSIN PEN. Thank you Camlin and Thank you Amazon It\\'s cool, it\\'s working, same product i received, they showing in cover photo.In this Box- CD Cady, Screw driver, 4 Screws.Easy to install,Before to use this slot, must check BIOS setup in your laptop.,Screws to hold HDD were missing,Good,Worst Quality wise + Not working Properly + Cheap class Circuit plate used inside Caddy, lagging issue after installation + Unable to open & run games after using this caddy because of worst transfering speed request to every one don\\'t waste your money in this type of product.,Won\\'t fit perfectly with crucial ssd,but will work without any issues .,I like it,Working properly no any issue,For the price, this is really good and easy to install.

ORDER NOW.Find my videos in Instagram using this S5 at shankarkumaran tamil,The selfie stick is sturdy and very good I bought this item in August 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as I\\'ve come to expect from Amazon. Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct support.The only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup.1. Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didn\\'t actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.2. Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever - I must have removed and re-inserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. No error messages showed up, and I didn\\'t know if I had recieved a faulty product, or if I was doing something wrong.3. Never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide might\\'ve helped here.Except for the these minor concerns in setup, I\\'m enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers (alongside projectors ) are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. I\\'ve used all the features so far - print ( colored, double sided), scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges.< Information on the number of color and black-and-white sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when I run out>,good scanner & printer,Installation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high. I had a Xerox copier, but istallation of scanner option could not complete.,If you are purchasing it for your home use, don\\'t look any further. It has got all the functions you\\'ll find in a 20-30k worth printers. All in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, Colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. Only two issue that I faced, firstly the print quality(which I\\'ll speak to the service center) and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90%. I guess I\\'ll have to purchase a larger cartridge.,Very good printer. Sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage. But overall very happy,gud printer but printing cost is expensive. in this price range features are very nice.,I got this printer ion 02Nov2022, After 15days of usage ..I\\'m unable to print as it is showing Color & black ink is low ..i have print less than 50pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield which is totally wrong.,Cannon E4570.This was launched as a successor for E4270 (I searched everywhere but couldn\\'t find a credible source to explain the differences between the two). I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled (so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop), clear color print (decent for child\\'s homework, photo quality not required) and cheap to run. E4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so I ordered this. Even the canon authorised showroom didn\\'t have E4570 in stock, so ordered the E4570 off Amazon.Summary - fullfills top two criteria. Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.Delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon, so that was great. It was just the printer box, with no outer packing. The box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so I suspect it had been opened at some point. Thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.Setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. I never had to use the usb cable. Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website (link for both given in manual), which guides step by step on how to setup. I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.Color prints are a bit faded on plain paper (75gsm). This might be a function of the paper and not the printer. The black&white prints are crisp and sharp. The print speed is decent.The only negative is the amount of ink consumption. While the box says 180 color prints and 300 b&w, both my cartridges are showing at 80% after 4 color print and around 30 b&w. Specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 2-3 prints. I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 30-40 full color pages. Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarely.A special mention for the ADF and duplex printing. Both the features are extremely useful. Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.Overall, I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. I will update the review if I run into any issues. Best for this price range, all-rounder in gaming and productivity.,Nice,Sometimes ssd not showing in the laptop,Also giving screw for mounting the ssd.,MS Windows:I have got this nvme m.2 P3 and i was unable to find it anywhere in the Disk Management (\"diskmgmt.msc\") or Device Manager (\"devmgmt.msc\"), neither as RAW/unallocated, nor Unknown Device. Although i was able to detect in BIOS (mine is basic for current usage - 07WP95), so i did not give up:Funny it may sound, no repair app. worked except for Windows Memory Diagnostic (Win+R -> \"mdsched.exe\") -> Restart now and check (recommended) -> Let it run for a while (mine took a 30 minutes i guess, i did not keep track of) -> after reboot you will find it (choose GPT in diskmgmt.msc) RAW and use it however you wish.For linux users:I did not try this there (coz i quit distro hopping also) but a year before i was able to find partitions (by Ventoy) which are not visible in Windows (anywhere), they are visible in my favorite utility: GParted (not sure if it were available on Windows though) use GPT table here as well.,Fantastic performance and reduced boot time with my Lenovo S145. Boot time has reduced from few minutes to 15 sec. Running performance is very much improved. Just go for it. Only concern is , I dont see the screw with this SSD to fix it in laptop.,Does not come with a screwdriver, had to buy a separate tool kit just for this simple installation, other than that everything else is perfect. Great speeds and performance, did a little benchmark using crystaldiskmark and I\\'ve gotten good scores overall.NOTE: that I recommend using momentum caching provided exclusively by crucial firmware/software which allows you to boost your overall performance of your SSD at the cost of more ram usage, and if you are using momentum caching make sure to ONLY use it if you have a laptop with a battery backup or If a PC than a UPS since I\\'ve seen data loss and corruption happening due to abrupt power lost and data files getting corrupted and lost forever if you were in the middle of something. This was my experience and I\\'m happy with the product so far, great job crucial.,Good product done some test speed was around 3100 MBps as my system was not very new but it is a good product value for money at this price point. Sturdy packing, good product!,Have used this brand cable for my iPhone and iPad before, so when my wife\\'s Samsung charger cable gave up the ghost in less than 6  months, I ordered this. Braided, visibly high quality cable, unlike the flimsy and highly overpriced OEM cables from Apple and Samsung. I have been using my iPhone cable from Wayona for more than 1 1/2 years and still going strong.  Hope this C cable will give a similar performance,I like Wayona chords and especially the long ones. But I get a slight shock - like a static discharge - when I touch my phone while charging with these two cords. Other cords with same charger are okay.,Ok,Cable looks solid and length is also good.Little bit fast charging I observed for phones like Redmi.It also looks solid so I am expecting it to work for atleast 1 year,build quality and fast charging feature,Unbreakable, good quality,Cable a Nice Product https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mathm1apL._SY88.jpg,Really, first of all, I found it bulky not sure whether it has good sound or loud sound but believe me guys if you are a sound lover just go for it. It has a really good sound as every sound is separated &  crystal clear.,Nice,Ya satisfactory work. Speed okay,Performance is very good.,64 GB in such a small size! Wow,Value for money,Good Duracell never disappoint you,Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811nzyzU05L._SY88.jpg,I use these batteries in my faber stove (4 Burner) and i assume many of you will be buying for the same purpose. It is long lasting and easily lasts in my house for 6-8 months without showing and signs of discharge. In the past 3 years, I’ve never experienced a single incident of leakage from this battery. Duracell Ultra batteries are the best for high power appliances to last long. This pack of 2 will easily last you an year.,Like:1) The batteries are in good condition.2) I required for Gas Stove. By putting this battery, I could light the burner without any hiccups.3) Cannot talk about durability as I have bought few weeks back.,Nice,GOOD, Bought it for my niece. It\\'s very convenient for kids to use it. The product serves as a slate, but with the advantage that kids can quickly write and draw dust-free and erase on a single click. The brightness of the screen could have been better.,Worthable product,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71iGsGyDR8L._SY88.jpg,Thank you Amazon, it\\'s a very nice writing pad what I expected and very useful for kids. It\\'s easy to use and saving stationary,Product is ok ok type. Cost should be around 300 as item used by children and we can\\'t expect much life.,Value for money,Light weight,thought to be bigger in size. But OK u can go with it. You have to be in a well lit room to do any srub on this pad. Pls comment... Ye extra 2ab Kaha se aaya ab pata chala mathematicians... Aur jet kaise radar se bachega... #pappuPM If you are looking for a decent laptop and resonably priced this is the one. I liked the laptop and carries out my normal daily task with ease. Booting is quite fast and infact automatic boot once you lift the upper panel. Quite fast and snappy no lags with good audio quality. The only  complain is all the ports are on the left hand side of the laptop that makes it inconvenient. Also one more missing element is type c port. Overall a decent product.,Works well, and no issues. Got the warranty registered with Lenovo to match the purchase date. The laptop speed is fast. Battery backup is fine. So far no signs of over-heating.  The screen resolution is good. The initial default setting of brightness was too high, however a darker theme is easier on the eyes.  Overallreading comfort is good.  Windows 11 and lifetime MS office apps are good/as expected.  This is a good laptop for students, home use activities, DIY, etc...  The MacAfee LiveSafe offer popup of rs 199 was good for a years protection. The Two year default lenovo warrant is as advertised.  The Sound is loud from the speakers. Keyboard quality if good.  Upgradability from 8GM to 12GB/DIMM max is good to have for future. The 512GB SSD is fast. Can be upgraded to a TB in future.  Overall quality is good, nothing to complain about. Did not need any installation support.,Value of money,One RAM module is soldered down. so matching 8gb ram sticks can\\'t be installed. Good choice for 32-35k budget. Windows 11 is a pain point.,Being an IT person i was hesitant to go for it but ultimately baught it and it was right decision. Laptop is good for normal home use.,Battery 3 - 4hr coming,Excellent product....great experience....,Battery power 3 h Product is good. It\\'s definitely a peace for ears because the padding is also very good. One thing that I don\\'t like is the wire is too short.,Never expected an easy on pocket brand like BoAt winning heart the way apple does! Good product In 800rs,Good product,Superb,The headphones live up to your expectations coming at an affordable price.The sound quality is top notch. Talking about the noise cancellation feature, it indeed cancels out the exterior noise, I had put it on my ears, played a song and simultaneously played another song on my TV, I really could not hear my TV\\'s sound. I liked the design and it feels quite appealing.Now I have two problems with the headphones firstly being it cannot be put on for a longer period of time. Adds a little bit of stress over your ears and they start to ache not much though but that\\'s quite a concern. Second being the length of the wire, it\\'s very long and often it annoys you because it doesn\\'t get fit into pockets and all quite easily. Overall a quality product at this rate and I recommend to buy anyone who\\'s interested and willing to give a shot at buying this headphones.Packaging of the product can be much better. I\\'m unsatisfied with the delivery of this product.,It was my second boat product which I have purchased and 1st headphone more than five hundred. and its experience is simply awesome. I have been using it past 11 months.,The sound quality is perfect, even when the sound volume is around 10 - 12,The sound is very good for price and mic quality is also decent but it is not comfortable. Your ears feel pain when you take it off, but for this price range it is the best thing. Super product,Worst product,Too good product,Good,Since long I was waiting for someone to manufacture a simple mobile set of pocket radio size so that I could listen online stations with reasonable sound quality.  As we know  what ever qualities a modern mobile set may have, the audio produced by it is always dry with no bass content.  So either we have to connect it to a music system or have to use headphones which are harmful to ears in the long run. Recently when I was surfing internet I saw this product which looked like an old radio.  On verifying the details I found this fulfills my requirement and without delay I placed order.Zebronics Astra 10 is having excellent audio quality with sufficient bass and treble content  just  like radios of olden days. The hollow space around the speaker adds to the bass  effect.  If we rotate the set and make the speaker to face us, the sound becomes more crisp.  Even with full volume  sound does not distort.Bluetooth connectivity also is marvelous  and connects within no time and there are no breaks and delay in audio transmission.  Battery backup also appears to be good.  After fully charging once I am using it daily and after 3 days still it is showing 80% charge.  Though there is no provision to know the remaining charge in the product, the mobile from which we are connecting bluetooth  shows the details.Normally we can not expect much from FM Radio in such type of gadgets. But this product is exception for that.  By attaching a small wire to the whip antenna I could listen FM station situated 200 KM away as if was local one.Aux, USB and mSD card facilities also work well.But I felt the on/off switch should have been some what sturdy.  Long press type button would have been a better option. Also scanning of FM stations  should have been on long press instead of single press to avoid accidental scanning.Over all it is a great product.To give it a nostalgic look while enjoying online radio,  I used the picture of our old National Ekco Radio\\'s tuning dial as the home screen of the mobile.I use this for personl TV audio listening as well.Chidambar KakathkarMangalore,Poor sound quality,Worthy,You cant use it if the mobile is slim or more petite. I bought this for my mom; her mobile is a slim model and doesn\\'t have a case, and the mobile keeps falling if you tilt it. Overall it is a good product. After 10 days of use bhaut acha chl rha ha and I will review again aapko bata dunga kessa ha Thoda time BaadBut Product acha ha Abhi tak kuch kharab nahi hua and mene bhe isska khayal rakha ha,pencil is good working good but build could be better,Excellent experienceWorks well with Ipad Pro 11 inch (2022)Good battery lifeNo need to buy overpriced apple pencil,Brilliant product. Adds value to the iPad. Thankfully the alternative to otherwise expensive brand pencil.,Really a great product by king one ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.

Osm product and I didn\\'t faces any ancidental power off as other pencils it\\'s cool and automatic swich off in it\\'s idel time save battery it like all rounder I can made a note and draw the paintings and so many other things .I am a student it\\'s saves moeny it\\'s best in one forth price of original one Cool......,Great quality with noags,For all those who can not afford the Apple Pencil, this one is a real problem solver. Its a little hard to get used to the pencil but works like a charm. zero issues. Lovely product,Initially I was sceptical using this pencil, because it kept skipping lines and became unresponsive. But after a while it became as smooth as original. You must go for it if pressure sensitivity is not what you are looking for. With wireless charging and button shortcuts it’s the best budget pencil. I will update my review to 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ after using and testing it for a while if it passes all the criterion. Thankyou. Best quality,The product looks original-like and is perfectly working with my OnePlus 8T. Good Type-C to C buy, recommended over other companies.,its a very good product and yet a reliable and durable cable to get yourself connected,Cable is good and support 65 w fast charging. I am use this cable to my one plus 8t mobile phone. This cable also speed in transfer to data. Cable price is also low. Thanks for seller to provide best quality and durability cable in low price. I am happy for saying this cable is all-rounder.,The product worked  fine for me. Got this at good price,Flexible and toughness is best workAnd also in samsung m31s mobile fast charging,I bought this cable for my nothing phone 1 it\\'s amazing, fast charging is working very well I\\'ve tried this also my samsung mobile, and result was fabulous, thanks,Initial impressions are good. It is supporting ulatra fast charging on my OnePlus 9 pro. Was working fine with window 10 old computer but is not installable with new system on Window 11,Overall very good item,Easy to install ok signal,This was used to accesd wifi connectivity for desk top, and TV, worked fine,👍,like,Good product, satisfied with its performance.,It worked on most devices where driver could be installed, even worked with linux system too but for the reason I bought simply didn\\'t get solved with it.. though not returning it as it worked in my computer without any issues. bright enough to read in close proximity, can light up room. get little heated but not an issue. build quality is good. Bit pricey for sure but can\\'t go wrong with it. Hope manufacturer put switch for on/off.,Very useful for WFH,Working perfect great... Product,The product is simply adjustable and brightness is enough for a study tableEase of useRecommended for students,I found it matches my requirement and also good by material used..overall good buying decision,Enough brightness but there is no control to turn off or dimmable from the led light. Like Mi LED light have option to dim and switch off. But it doesn\\'t have, so turn off or turn on the light, you will need to plug in or remove it from power bank. Can\\'t keep connected in power bank as it always turns on light when connected,If the button of Adjustable of brightness was present....then the product was marvelous,It is helpful for me in my wfh at late night due to this product light is switch off and everybody will sleep without any distraction and also I can complete my work Good Bass and Treble. Good Sound Quality.,Good product in this price,In this more irritating is the deep bass after putting speaker in deep bass the volume automatically decrease when there is a bass in the song and volume is only for the room it can\\'t be used in bigger room\\'s,As little giving good sound specially during video chat in laptop.,Crisp and clear balanced sound.Good bass for its size.Value for money,Good,Value for money,I feel good with this item Somehow Amazon sucks when you want to select an electric kettle. There are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter. It is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need. In this review I will answer your questions about the PIGEON AMAZE PLUS 1.5L ELECTRIC KETTLE.1. Can I trust the reviews for this ad? Are they genuine?Probably yes. But know that the seller lists several types of PIGEON Kettles in the same ad. Unless the review refers to this particular model - you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one. The ratings are also an aggregated mix. There could be 10 negative review of the product you are seeing and 10 positives for the other products. The page will show you a neutral review. That\\'s the game sellers are playing these days - to avoid negative reviews. I have posted a picture of the stove I am referring to in this review.2. WATTAGE: Important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up. This one is 1500W - meaning that you can switch it on ... brush your teeth and find the water is boiled. Great time saving !! My earlier one was 900W and it used to take 10-15 minutes of patient waiting. The gas stove boiled water faster. This one takes about 3-4 mins to heat 2 mugs of coffee3. CABLE LENGTH: Most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length. I have purchased kettles to find they have only a 2-foot long cable ... and I had to return them. This one has cable length of 22\" (slightly more than one meter) - which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug.4.  CONNECTOR:  This one uses a 6A plug - which is most common in India. Be careful because from >1500W onwards, most kettles use a 16A plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle. Strictly speaking, it should have a 16A plug, but then this is kept on for short intervals only.5.  CAPACITY:  1.7 litres as mentioned - though I could not see markings for max and min levels. This is good enough to make 4-5 decent sized mugs of coffee6.  COOKING OTHER STUFF:  The ad says only water - but I see no reason why you cannot heat Maggi etc. Maybe you can. But avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects.7. LOOKS: Quite okay for the price. It will not make your kitchen look bad - and neither will it enhance the looks. This is the most common look that an electric kettle can have.8. PERFORMANCE: I have used for 2 days only. No complaints so far. There is a 1-year guarantee card accompanying the product9. HANDLE: Very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle. Does not feel very heavy even if there is a full 1.7L of water.10. NEGATIVES: This is a steel jug. The outside will automatically heat up. If you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle, you need to be a little careful.VERDICT - \"BUY\"(at the time of writing this review, this costs less than Rs 700. I have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews - therefore I am also mentioning the price range based on which I gave this product a 5 star review),The body is very lightweight and doesn\\'t feel sturdy. Does the job of heating water fast and that\\'s it. Cord length could be a little longer. The plastic parts doesn\\'t feels sturdy. The top cap has a smaller dia so a man\\'s hand has a trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands.

The accuracy is a bit off so i weigh the items again and again and use the majority result.,Like 1st product came faulty got it replaced , replacement is still working as good as new after a few months , recommended as it seems once you get a proper product it is long lasting , do get your faulty one replaced if you get it though.,Ya I love it this for easy to use and clean very useful when u want to chop a juicy tomato or leafy veggi and also size also quite good for smaller family,Do not work after 15 days,Good and smooth working,Good,Easy to operate,The product was good to use for chopping , especially for office goers like me...

Water filtering holes are big enough.

Bad service by prestige so never go for this product.,very good product,Medium type,The fiber or plastic handle becomes hot, so does the outer body. Difficult to handle immediately after heating.

Steel finishing is normal and not shining.,Product is working fine for now but lets whats gonna happen. and yeah the packaging could have done better :),Good, most suitable winter use.,Good product,Review after some month of used. No problem yet. Good Quality..Valuable price.,Okay productGood to handle,Very nice product thank you Amazon If you are buying this as a secondary cooking appliance  or you need a portable stove, go for this.Also buy thin induction compatible utensils. It takes a very long time for thick vessels to heat up before you can start cooking.As a primary cooking appliance, this doesn\\'t suit as it\\'s very time consuming. Can be used for keeping things hot or slow boiling milk etc.Also had to request a warranty repair. The request was served within 2 days. The contact information is present on the warranty card.,Just received it. Though the product looks new, there are few scratches here and there making me unhappy.Compared its performance with other induction cook top that I have (with same amount of water at same temperature in the same vessel).Sadly this cook top is a tad slow to boil compared to the old one.But, I think that is okay, because the old one which I have is Rs. 1000 more than this one.,Product good but its take long time to cooldown,कमाल का प्रॉडक्ट हे,Good,Value for Money,Good product.easy to operate,Value for money..

My needs are fulfilled. Thank you.,Good product,Product looks good but Boiling milk in this kettle burns the base of the kettle it becomes full black and brown ,And eggs don\\'t get boiled in a single go .,Nice product,After 2 months of usage, some issues have come up. Once it gets to the boiling point, it should automatically switch off but it keeps on bubbling till it is switched off manually. Next is that the water vapors and heat can be felt through the kettle on/off switch which I believe is dangerous. We ordered this trusting Prestige to be of high quality but it doesn\\'t satisfy the purpose.,After using only one month kettle on /off switch is not working and red light is also not working.Some times it\\'s boiling time is too fast and some times too slow.,This catle works good but difficult to clean . The lint remover actually removes the lint :). It is not a gimmick but an actual working machine. it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around. Using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference. I used it on 2-3 clothes and am very happy with the result. Let me describe the pros and cons:Pros:1. Very easy to use2. Removes any kind of lint3. it also removes lint that is not visible i.e. of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older. so your clothes look a bit like the new ones.4. lint is collected in a container that is easy to cleanCons:1. The process is very very slow. you need to move the machine on the cloth surface a number of times.2. the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys. it may break if fallen on a hard surface.3. the cable length is very small. The plug comes off the socket easily. you need to sit very close to the socket making it a bit difficult to use sometimes.4. the lint collector comes off very often5. the rotor blades make a weird noise as if they are going to break.6. the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lint-free which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it. you will use it once and will never touch it again. however, you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on a wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straight.other than that it is a good product and can be tried.Thanks,product is good overall, working fine but the seller should pack it more carefully as i received the upper detachable part in a broken condition as it is  non replaceable makes it more difficult for the customer,but coming to the working part the product quality is good, wotks fina and removes everything easily.a must buy product for winter.,I have used a similar product earlier but this one works better and size is also very effective, using is very ergonomic and like I said, does the job well. Come with a small brush to bruah off samll residue on the fabric. Would recommend buying this. Delivery and packaging was good too.,Easy to clean easy to use. Does the job. Received the product fast and in perfect condition. There is a leaflet inside promising 6month warranty. If it provides that it\\'s teh perfect product for this price.,This is very product it cleans all lint from my woolen clothes but it have 1dislike store area is very less and slim it have problem for cleaning store area and the product is very good,This is very good. Life save in winters to remove lint from your costly winter wear. I have used it on some heavy lint area in my inner wear and it’s really removed the lints and now I can wear my inner again.,product is so satisfying and easy to use that a child can remove lint from his clothes. product overall is satisfying expect the the compartment where lint get consolidated it gets loose in every movement,Product is good and solve the lint problem very effectively so go for it This is best heater in this range. Only  You need 16amp socket to use this.,Product is gud to use n easy to handle but it was damaged from the joint as it seems it was opened and/or repaired, also it not in the plastic wrapper in the company box...Yesterday i.e. the next day on 28.12.22, I received d replaced product by d seller n it was well n neatly packed n working quite well.. so I reviewed the earlier rating from 3 star to 5 star...👍,Awesome product, but the packing was worst,very disappointed from Amazon, the box was broken &some scratches also,,This is sufficient for one room use, especially for baby in winter, it\\'s very good at heating the room. Worth of money.,God product,I used this product since January 2022 and now this device working smoothly and very easy.,Lu It works as expected, but the shape of the handle is not very comfortable. It is not feeling very handy to hold the device and press the button at the same time, sometimes the battery  door opens while using it.,It’s easy to use but creates a mess when I try to make coffee froth. Doesn’t form froth also. Only runs under liquid.,The frother stops spinning in even slightly dense liquid.,Product is not working smoothly...after very hard press the button then it works.,Easy to use and nice product. But cream stucks in it sometimes,Can finally make frothy dalgona coffee without losing my arm lol worth it! Coffee came out really well and so easy to use,,Good Light weight. Easy to use. But the Packaging is really problem, I opened with a fear that product might be damaged. It was not thankfully !!  No covering nothing, first time felt very bad on Packaging issue.. need to improve on that,The item just got delivered today. The product specifications says it has 360° swivel cord, but actually it has 180°.  Otherwise the productbis very good. 2 years warranty card present. I will update after usage.,Very Good Couality Iron And Faster Heat And Easy To Handel ,,, Nice product,Light weight,Go for it,My initial experience was slightly disappointing, but after exchanging the product its working well, satisfactory,100% -perfect,According to price good but heating element not heat property not to much heating overall goog पार्टी में फिश बनाने के लिए लगातार लगभग 5किलो लहसुन ,पोस्ता दाना , सरसो तथा अन्य मसाले की पिसाई की,Ok but quality not good,Thoda product small h baki sb mst h,Good,I did not get warranty card,Good for small family.,OK 👍,If you can afford it, go for more well known brands in the mixer business. This one is cheap quality but great for the price.Please note that there\\'s a burning smell for quite a few uses. Also, if you grind for more than 10-15 seconds, it tends to \\'trip\\'. Then you have to let it cool down and push the red button at the base to restart it.You can easily make dosa batter, chutneys etc. Just soak the rice and urad dal overnight since it\\'s not very sturdy. Worth the penny:Used for 2 days, on time delivery, next day installation by havells and every good installation support from havells.Water gets heating within 5 mins and you have to open half tap for continuous flow of hot water. Sufficient for bucket bathing and the good part is heating indication. One thing is missing in the geyser is Temp control, but overall Best in this price range (3 ltrs).,The product was delivered on time and as promised by Amazon.Upon receiving the water heater, I received a text from Havells for the installation of the product. The installation process was smooth apart from the fact that one needs to purchase a 16A three-pin socket (wall plug not included with the water heater). There are no installation charges and my only gripe with the water heater is no plug!!The water heats up very quickly (5 mins approx.) and retains temperature for good 4 hours. Light indicators show heat stages (Heating or Heated) Even though one will find many alternatives at better prices additional costs for installation and accessories should be taken into account.Bonus marks for getting the design correct.,It\\'s compact yet efficient. Does its job well. I expected a bit quicker heating though. Installation guy came the very next day. All the accessories required was provided in the package.,But light is not working not within 2 weeks,Easy to install. Value for money.,Its a good product in terms of usability, easy to useAll in all its a great Instant geyser product with this price range. Installation was easy and it’s meets our expectations I would recommend this product to purchase.,Easy installation. Purchased for kitchen. Working well.,Nice product and good service During winter it keeps room temperature hot which reduced cold. We really enjoy the product,If your place is air tight this 9 fin Radiotor heater will be enough. But my place is not air tight that\\'s why I am not satisfied.,Product could use a user manual.Number of fins required for so and so size of rooms needs to be described,Can not working. We are just using it without fan. Don’t have patience for exchange/return now.,Overall good,Good 9 Fin Oil Filler Room Heater from Morphy Richards. Reduced one star as there is no PTC Fan in this. Remaining all features working as expected.,Good product. Used 10 kWh unit electricity for full night run in Agra with min temperature at 7degrees. Keeps the small 10x10 foot room warm enough to be able to sit in light jacket.Heats up room slowly as expected, unlike coil based heaters. But less danger and doesn\\'t impact skin.Easy to setup the rollers.For a bigger room, go for 11fins model and not 9 fins model.,People who are saying that screws didn\\'t come. Please check under lower thermocol. Screws are there. I raised return request bought new Morphy richards from store and found this thing. So cancelled the return request. I got 2 now because of this issue. Why Morphy richards? Why hiding it away where people are not able to find it?Overall product is really good, please go for it. Good product,The product is good if offer is applied.,Like the way it looks,Very good produce, quality is really good. we\\'ve been using this from last 8 months, works perfectly fine.,We\\'ve been using it for 2 years and there\\'s no issues yet. We have carried along with us for travelling as I have a small baby. And u need to boil water every now and then. I not only use it for boiling water. We make tea/coffee, boiled egg, boiled apple and also Maggie while travelling 🙂 One star deducted because of the length of the chord.,wire short,Nice,It\\'s awesome!Much more than expected. 👍🏼So elegant and sturdy...

Connection pipes are not provided this time.Due to this the total cost rises up to ₹3000. Previously it was provided with the heater.,Very nice and working well taking 2-3 minutes for 3 liters. For one bath we using twice, means 6 liters hot water. No temprature control and not included connecting pipes.,Very nice,works well. just as described. looks great and easy to installhowever the tank is really small, so it keeps switching on when taking a bath. Especially if u have a shower the pressure gets lower trying to heat it all up,Easy to install and operations,A very fantastic product at this point,Suitable for 2-3 persons Everything is fine in this product but the only cons for this product is once you heated water it doesn\\'t maintain that temperature and gets cold very soonother than that everything is great like design , heating ,usage ,easy to clean,good to use,Nice product,The only problem with this kettle is that you have to restart again and again,good to use and time saver.,Overall good.

Temperature control also works well, overall a steal deal for price below 6000.Totally recommended for usage.

This is, without any doubt the best purchase I\\'ve ever made.If you have polyester, polyester+cotton, acrylic, acrylic+wool or acrylic+polyester clothes you know that after sometime (maybe years, could be months) they will start to pill. Pilling is those small round blobs on the cloth: make the item look old and haggard, as if they\\'ve hand me downs.Well, this product will reset it back to its original look and feel. It\\'s crazy how good it works, on socks, sweaters, mufflers, caps, gloves, fleece jackets, fleece pants, anything that has artificial fibre composition.Don\\'t but the one with battery because you\\'ll be restricted to the capacity of the battery and when it degrades the product is useless - corded is the way to go for me.Five stars without a doubt.,Easy to use and very useful product.,I am very happy,Made Plastic could have been better,Good product ,Works really well...,Removes lint in one go. Good to use. First time user.,Good,Very easy to use and it works really well. Leaves a near nd clean fabric after removing the lint completely.

Need to buy another socket of 16amp to make this product usable. Otherwise it will be of no use.,Nice product. It warm the 1 bucket water in 5m.,Branded and good quality,I have used this product twice since the purchase and it\\'s good. The cord length can be increased more,so that it will be easy to use. The water is getting heated in a short span of time. There is a minimum and maximum marking on the heater and the heater should be immersed inside the water till the minimum markings compulsaryly.. so if u are going to heat a half bucket of water it won\\'t be used.,Product is good, wire lenth and cord lenth are enoughSuper easy to use but packing shi se ki hui nhi hoti4 star for good product but removed 1 star for bad packing,Nice one,Good It\\'s take approximate 2 minute to water boiling. So it is easy to use,Warranty should be actual as I have some issues with its inner surface, let\\'s see if I get a help,It\\'s a good product,Very strong plastic odour after heating water, better go for kettle with glass lids.,It is very nice kettle for home & kitchen use. Its steel quality is very good,I use Inalsa kettle  it is a very good product. It’s very easy to operate easy to clean and a very quick way to get hot water.,Very good product and helpful and polite delivery person,Cord length is very short. Difficult to reach to table Product is good. But giving 4 star only due to bad packaging. Box was in open condition.,Fast Cook,Easy-to-use,Nice,Like this product,I am writing this review exactly after 3 years of usage. I bought it in around 1700, it was a great deal. I never faced any issue with the induction functionality in these 3 years. But after 1.5 years the outer body which is made of plastic fiber started cracking from back side due to heavy load. And now after 3 years, the fan has stopped working and I other issues started showing. I am yet to visit the local repair shop to get it repaired, once done will update further...,Nice product 😌,nice product Reviewing just after a day of using this product. We made French fries and chicken tikka and result is quiet impressive! The recipe book and cooking tips from the given QR code is really helpful. Hope it serves for a long time.Not to forget about the beautiful bottle green and golden look of it.,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lT2gsd9sL._SY88.jpg,No detailed user manual.. no idea about the cooking time. How to use is not describe.,It works well and plastic quality is poor but it can wothstand the temperature for sure. Its not a toy to look for high quality plastic. And for the half the price that the other models, we can ignore that.Functionality wise its perfect.Just buy it,Don\\'t go for costly products as it is available in a reasonable price and it has so many great features. I\\'m happy with it,Pigeon never dissapointd with their quality. The best way to have healthy, crispy food.,The outcome of cooked is not up to the mark.  The recipe book was not attached so,  it is difficult to know how to cook different dishes.  I tried some but outcome was bad.  Definitely you will have to compromise taste if you use this appliance.  I\\'m very much worried about the current consumption.  Think before you buy these air fryers. Good product specially for hostelers. Value for money. And it looks good in your room.,Item is very good and met my expectation,It is good for single or double people sharing room,I really recommend this. Best product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7168PizheiL._SY88.jpg,Very useful,Good product in this price. Go for this., Update as on 28.10.2018:*********************************The power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visible,the insulation pvc of the cores doesn\\'t look very durable.I don\\'t know why such standard manufacturers can\\'t provide a decent durable cable?The iron however is performing flawlessly.Still disappointed ,as in coming weeks i\\'ll have to change the cable for sure.Reducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such a big brand name.HOW IT STARTED - THE NEED FOR AN IRON:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRecently , my previous Bajaj make dry iron, which I received as a gift from somewhere, started giving problems after two years of occasional use & with “not so careful handling and care”. Initially, Its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which I repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems. Finally, its ON indication went OFF and I decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find a new one.Hence, my search for a reputed brand make , best value for money device began .Being from Electrical Engineering background & occupation, I fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below:1.) DRY IRON VS STEAM IRON :xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that a steam iron could perform as a dry iron but vice-versa was not possible. Also, almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purpose.On the contrary, As the steam  loosens the individual fibres of the clothes, the steam iron\\'s pressing action smooths out wrinklesHence it was better to be  equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself.2.) BRAND REPUTATION & WARRANTY:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAs an average consumer, We are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have a higher quality and perform better. Rightfully so ,A brand which has been working with a product for decades has a plenty of experience & research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted upon.Following the same footprints I thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the Super brands like Philips having decades of expertise in this field..Our product comes with a two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion .3.) STEAM OUTPUT , STEAM BURST & VERTICAL STEAM FEATURE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxDuring normal usage with steam a delivery of anything above 8 grams/min is okay but Some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require a much more supply of steam. In such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy. Users can push a button to receive a burst of steam when needed. More holes in the sole plate add  to the effectiveness of steam  supplied.Vertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam  in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for a pressing force.However in practical scenario and by virtue of  its design and water tank limitations , a steam iron is virtually incapable of  addressing the wrinkles like that and  hence paying more for such a feature is not advised.Use dedicated garment steamers for that purpose.** Our Philips GC1905 comes with a variable setting for steam  output with a continuous delivery of  up to 17 grams/min which is quite good.Additionally, It can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles. Vertical steam feature is not available though.4.) ELECTRICAL RELATED FEATURES: WATTAGE, CORD,THERMOSTAT etc.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks.1. Surely, more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above 1500 Watts , I would suggest to only plug-in to the power sockets.Going for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you  really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times.2. Surely, More heat developed  is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective ,Your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settings.Generating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system.3. Last but not the least - More power  doesn’t always mean  quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon a number of factors like the material & thickness of the sole plate , Surface area of  the heating element used  inside the soleplate etc.Most of  these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer.** OUR PRODUCT:# Comes with a decent 1440 Watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics.# Comes with a 250 Volts, 10 Amp ( Max. rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage) 3 pin Top which can  be easily plugged into our casual 6 amp sockets as well without any damage to the socket.Hence enhanced mobility & performance.# The cord length is around 1.8 meters which is good enough for any practical lengths,Any more than that would be cumbersome to handle.. The cord  is braided with an insulated  cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during a cable damage.However in due course of use, the cord often develops rigid twists & turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten out.So not so great on the cable quality terms.# The cable only comes with 180 degrees of swivel movement, which is quite disappointing and I would  have  really wished if it was 360 degrees of cord freedom.# The thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular 5 settings but going with a reputed brand like Philips always assures of a good quality of thermostat.After all, the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable.# Lastly our product is an ISI marked product  which is quite an assurance for sure.5.) SOLEPLATE MATERIAL & SHAPE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThis is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplates.A variety of soleplates are available in the market today like non-stick Teflon coated ,aluminium plates with American  heritage coating, Steel plates with alloys or Ceramic coated.Each has its pros and cons.# Teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over a period of time.# American Heritage is similar to Teflon and glides over the fabric even better.# Stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settings.Adds weight to the device. Metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers.# Good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution  but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stick.When  ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex, a ceramic iron will suit your needs best, as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling.# Aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes.** Our Product comes with a linished soleplate which  is quite inadequate detail as linishing is a process of grinding or polishing a surface to make it a perfect flat.# However apart from linishing stuff, I can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding, Its heavy but doesn’t stick to the clothes yet.For that matter I trusted  the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate. Stay away from Teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off  fast.Regarding the shape , I honestly wanted  it to look like American fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colors..LOL..However ,those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this “Still-Decent Looking “model.6.) FEATURES LIKE ANTI DRIP ,ANTI-CALC, GRIP:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxTo tell you the truth these are more of a fancy terms rather than actual purpose  for most of the users. Presence of these features, isn’t a problem  though , as in areas where the water comes hard, Anti-calc may stir and clear the calcium build up ,if any in the water tank.However ,If you use proper water, drain it out timely , Do not fully fill the tank , allow it to heat before using steam  & follow all procedures correctly, you won’t actually need to use these features.Regarding Grip ,Many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give a better grip.** Our product comes with the anti-calc function  and is decent to grip though I think not ergonomically, still nothing for a deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon.7.) PRICE VS PERFORMANCE:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxEven though I did not have any preset price tag in my mind  but still going over 2500 would have definitely felt extreme for a thing that I don’t make use of that much.** I bought it at a price of around 1200 bucks & for  all the features and performance it delivers - I think it is worth it.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all , I would just say, that even though our product might not have the best  appealing looks or the best soleplate or  the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord , still, what it has is  – a complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in a decent right-performing way, which is hard to come by in an  individual model.,I got this one on-demand from mother. For a few days, she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores. I was already researching iron for one of my friends. So this search did not last long. :DEven earlier, Philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency & product quality. I also had Bajaj, Usha, Morphy in the list. But trust in Philips did not let me go for any other brand.I got this Iron well in one piece and without any scratches on the soleplate.•••••••••••••••INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••→Steam Iron inside a poly pack→Instruction leaflet/Warranty card•••••••••ABOUT•••••••••Wattage: 1440 wattWeight: ~1 kgWater Capacity: 180 mlCord length: 1.8 meterIndicator: on/off (based on temperature setting)Max Water level markingWarranty: 2 years•••••••PROS•••••••1. Good quality iron with effective ironing & steaming.2. Body is solid with good finish overall at this range.3. Linished- Teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics. Gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture.4. Sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage.5. Capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation (30 min or more in one fill).6. Spray function is well designed, it evenly sprays water and not just throws a fine jet of water.7. The spray function produces a fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric, making it easier to iron out tough creases.8. Wattage (1440w) is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes.9. Easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole.10. Easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole, and the sideways opening door.11. Weight on the ok side, not a lightweight but not even heavyweight. Some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth. (Empty iron is lightweight only.)••••••••CONS••••••••1. Steam control knob looks loose at first, but it works well in the long run.2. Water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation. But that\\'s the way it will work & you can\\'t do anything.3. For regular lightweight iron users, it will appear bulky at first. But you get used to it in a few days.4. No steam burst function in this model GC1905 but you get what you pay for.▶ Cons are temporary and don\\'t affect functionality in the long run. So a ★★★★★ device.•••••••••••••••••••••••••BUTTONS & KNOBS•••••••••••••••••••••••••Spray Button→ push to spraySteam Knob→ Off: no steam→ Low: less steam→ High: high steam→ Calc clean mode: calcium deposit cleaning (more below)Temperature Dial→ Rotate to set temperature cutoff for different fabric types (Linen, Cotton, Woolen, Silk, etc)••••••••••••••••••USAGE GUIDE••••••••••••••••••1. Keep knob & dial in off position.2. Fill the tank to the max level if planning to use steam function.3. Connect to mains.4. Set the temperature control knob to the required position.5. Let it warm up until the indicator goes off.6. Now operate steam knob to low or high steam.7. Enjoy ironing or steaming without interruption till water lasts.8. Use water spray function as required.•••••••••••••••USAGE TIPS•••••••••••••••1. Use RO filtered water if possible as it\\'s low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices.2. let the iron heat properly before use. Leakage has been observed if one uses the Iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam.3. Gently clean soleplate and don\\'t use any hard material or chemicals.4. Emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem. As calcium deposits are more in standing water.5. Untangle & straighten the cord once after every use before storage. As these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure.6. When not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position.7. Use calc clean mode once in 2 weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness. If water is very hard, increase the frequency or if using RO water decrease frequency.8. Once in a few months clean steam control needle using vinegar. To remove the needle, rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out.9. Last but most important, use a properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocks.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••CALC CLEANING MODE•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••This iron has a calc cleaning mode to descale it. To do so follow the steps below:1. Keep knob in the steam off position.2. Fill tank to max level.3. Rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off.4. Take out socket from mains and move iron to sink.5. Turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up a few cms.6. Let all water be used up.7. Steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits.▶ The principle behind this function is a sudden change in temperatures of inside zone, which leads to contraction & expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush out.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••CLARIFICATION: DAMAGE TO BODY OR PLATE & OTHER ISSUES (concerns raised by other users)•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Several users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues. Let me put my insights into those.→ I had no issue with the quality of the product delivered. It arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere, as proper care was taken for this using air cushions. Maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit.→ Soleplate had no marks on it. Yes, here Philips can provide a protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints, for the damaged sole plate on arrival.→ Temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage.→ Slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones, as different materials are used as per requirement. Say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back.→ Leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water. So it\\'s passed directly, & appears as leakage. Philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details.▶ Remember to order it from a reputed seller. Check seller ratings, reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues, like the faulty product, duplicate product, etc.••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••DON\\'T GET CONFUSED (There\\'s No Steam Burst Mode Here)••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. Some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button & even some users have mentioned this in their reviews, but it is not present in this model. Models with the said function have two buttons (for spray & burst) instead of one here (for spray only).2. Also, steam output at one place is 13g/min, another place 17g/min. Its actually 17g/min.•••••••••••••••••••FINAL VERDICT•••••••••••••••••••▶ If you are looking for good quality, durable steaming iron in the 1.5k range, Philips is the name you should seek for. This model of Philips has got good build quality & features which are more than enough for an average home user. So at any point, you can go for this model.▶ If on a lower budget (<1k range) you can go for Philips GC1011 1200w or Bajaj MX 3 1250w but both are low power and Philips one misses steam spray function too. But still, both will cover most of the usage pattern of a home user.▶ Heavy users may go for Philips EasySpeed Plus GC2040 2100w or Black+Decker BD BXIR2001IN 2000w or Morphy Richards Super Glide 2000w in 2k range.••••••••NOTE••••••••→ Unlike regular lightweight irons, steam irons generally don\\'t go easy with repairs.→ Unlike regular iron, If the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced & if you are out of warranty it will cost you a lot. In fact, for the cost of the plate plus a few bucks, you get a new iron.→ So, check your requirement for regular vs steam iron & choose wisely.,I tried removing hard wrinkles of a jeans but it couldn’t remove them properly. They were still visible even after using the steam.,Easyto use but it leaks water,Very good,Its a good product,Iron is good and the best delivery with few hours, just this iron doesn\\'t have a stream burst...rest is good,Simple cloth iron Immersion heaters have changed very little in terms of features or design over the 40 years or so I\\'ve been using them. And regardless of which brand name is stamped on them, they look like clones of each other. It was therefore with some excitement that I bought this Havells model that had at least three novel features: an auto-cut-off facility, a temperature control knob, and a protective plastic cover for that part of the heater users could come into accidental contact with. But quite a bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived. I couldn\\'t use it straightaway because it has a cord that\\'s barely a metre long, and it just couldn\\'t reach the 16A socket it needs to be plugged into. Such heavy-duty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms, so that they are easily accessible to any storage water-heaters that may be installed. Havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another foot-and-a-half to the cord length. For a large-scale manufacturer, this extra length would have made little difference to the production cost. The product, anyway, is priced a couple of hundred Rupees more than other 1500W heaters (the MRP being even higher, at Rs1000).In my case, therefore, the heater had to be \\'accessorized\\' before it could be used: I had to buy a stool that would raise the the bucket off the floor, and thus compensate for the shortness of the cord. And no, it can\\'t be any stool lying around in your home: it has to be a stool of a certain height, about 14 inches for me. Any taller, and the bucket can\\'t be accommodated under the tap; any shorter, and you begin cursing Havells again for their miserliness with the cord. The stool took two days to arrive, and I \\'inaugurated\\' the heater a full four days after it was delivered. Thank God my old immersion heater was still usable, in spite of its heavily calcified condition.There is yet another problem with this heater: though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings, you don\\'t know what value each setting corresponds to. What does \\'high\\' temperature mean -- 60 degrees Celsius? Seventy? I found out the hard way when I set the temperature high, and the heater wouldn\\'t switch itself off for 15 minutes, which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some 20 litres of water. And by then, the water had turned scaldingly hot. I tried the \\'medium\\' setting the next day, and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water. Perhaps the right setting is \\'low\\' then. I\\'m not sure. Neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the Havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting, and stop you burning yourself.So both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it -- the variable heat setting and the auto-cut-off-- ultimately turned out to be quite useless. I still have to depend on my instinct, and on my experience with my old \\'featureless\\' heater, and manually turn the heater off when I think it\\'s done its job.I have a question for other users of this product, or for the manufacturer: can the temperature be set to in-between values, something between \\'low\\' and \\'medium\\', for instance. The way the controlling knob is marked, with several lines between the presets, suggests this is possible. Or maybe that\\'s yet another \\'useless\\' feature of this fancy heater. More trial-and-error? But should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to use?UpdateAfter a week\\'s use of this heater, I\\'d like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users. Since the heater has its own indicator light, which switches off at the set temperature, you may forget to switch the socket switch off, particularly if the switch is away from the socket, as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door. If you forget to switch the socket off, and, in the meantime, have removed the heater from the bucket, it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value. This dry-heating will damage both the heater and wall, if you\\'ve hung the heater up. But, more significantly, it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet, and there\\'s no one around to switch the socket off for you. This happened to me twice. Call me dumb, if you want to, but please be careful.,The product is good and does its work. I didn\\'t find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot. It take just 5 to 7 mins to get the water be bath ready. Further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches, but that causes no trouble. It\\'s not shock proof so don\\'t check temperature of water with it turned on.,Product received with some scratchesDon\\'t know how inside package product gets scratchesOther than that all is okay product is goodAnd it\\'s shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch water,Value for money,Product is good & satisfactory, one minor issue the cord is little too hard.,Its working as expected. no issues found till now  but i have observed the red light is not coming fully. i could see only partial red light is visible. overall best product,nice,This product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of 16 amps which should have been of 6 amps I have been using this product from past few days, and it removes lint very efficiently. Very handy to use. However, sometimes some lint remains below blades and not completely expelled, but after cleaning it works fine. Overall, I\\'ll be giving it 4-star.,,A good product,would recommend to purchase a branded product than a non branded product,Really like the product,Overall good product,Agaro Is The Best,Its a nice product working just fine without any issues and built quality is nice as well,Wireless product Bottle quality is not good.,Best for hot water,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hGSlIeBIL._SY88.jpg,As per the price, bottle is not sturdy and very light weight. Kettle is also thin but heats fast. Like other market standard both bottle and kettle should be sturdy. Has to handle very delicately otherwise dent will be inevitable.,The product is a good package. The bottle accompanied is a regular steel bottle and not a thermos. The kettle is very difficult to clean so better avoiding doing anything which stains it. The switch seemed to get jammed but with a little push it started to work again.,Steel Quality not good,The kettle is good for winters. You can boil the water within a few minutes. But the length of cord is short. It would be better if it is long.Overall, the experience was good. You can go for it. It is truly an amazing product for your parents.

Heating capacity is good for Delhi chilling cold but the sound or noise is very irritating,It\\'s good for making a room hot with temperature.,Good purchase2.5 feet cord lambi hoti toh max aata mazzza,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71UUZy-5bpL._SY88.jpg, I am writting this after 4months usuage ,Go for it as suction power is too good, only cons is dust capacity is very limited as we need to clean frequently,It\\'s too heavy to be handle. And not good for deep cleaning. I tried to clean matresses and sofa but dusts were there.,Too early to write the review but working good so far,Likes:- Handy, easy to use, comparatively light- Cleans extremely well due to strong suction power.- looks good. Good clean design.- power cord is very long.- easy to store, doesn\\'t take up much spaceDislikes:- heated up quite a lot within 2 minutes (not even 5 minutes after cleaning an upholstered stool and foot rug). Had to switch off and let it cool. So obviously not something that can be used at a stretch to clean all your upholstery etc. like other(more expensive) vacuum cleaners- no flexible hose with the more expensive version with extension stick. When one has paid much more, providing the small flexible hose which is meant for cleaning inaccessible areas like underneath sofas, ceilings etc, was something i expected. I\\'m sure the hose itself is pretty inexpensive. They could easily have provided it at no extra cost. If one needs that hose, one needs to buy the less expensive unit (again!) just to get the hose as it\\'s not even available for sale separately.- manual is hopelessly inadequate, had to look up YouTube videos.- no soft brush provided for cleaning the filter.- does not come in Amazon packaging even though it\\'s fulfilled by Amazon. It\\'s just the Agaro box, think is closed by openable flaps, not even sealed. So we cannot be sure if it\\'s a returned defective product or brand new one.- No quality check sticker or anything assuring that the product has been checked before packing. On a YouTube video, there was a sticker at the joint of dust connector and main body, on mine there is no sticker, just slight sticky residue. So it\\'s been removed by someone. Not sure if it\\'s a returned product (again as there is no seals on the box). I don\\'t want to return this as i already had returned one box that was filthy with oil stains and had opened from the bottom (flaps had come apart), none of the attachments etc were sealed in their plastic cover packets.- Quite loud. Reading the reviews i thought it would be less noisy, but it\\'s not.- No blower  function (other brands in this range have). Would have been great to have this.- Only 3 attachments (floor / carpet brush, multipurpose brush, crevice nozzle) (other brands in this range have many more.- an extra filter would have been a good gesture to include.- not very light. If one wants to clean high surfaces like sides of ceiling or ceiling fans etc, one needs to lift it and hold in hand while cleaning. Very difficult to do especially for ladies (or at least me, a middle-aged lady). Again, here the flexible hose if provided, would have been handy. Someone could  hold the vacuum cleaner while using the hose to clean high areas.All in all, reasonably happy with this purchase - as it is a supplementary one to my existing 35+ year old Eureka Forbes vacuum cleaner which is still going strong, as the upholstery cleaning attachments for that model got lost.I do feel strongly though that the price could have been reduced considering all the above pros and cons.,Compact size,It is a light duty, light usage and a limited application area equipment. Not for effective & complete usage.,It’s a good vaccum, good suction and easy to clean up. However the suction sound is quite loud. Nevertheless it’s a good machine. Does the job well.,The product works well. It just heats up after using for 15mins. I recvd product within 3 dys while owing to rural area other product tks 10 dys to deliver n product recvd at gd condition n works well, aftr use if smthng cms up will review again,It works good. Nice heating. But hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges.. Other than that, fine product,2500 se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha. Use karne mein bahut achha hai,Over all I\\'m really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience. I was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature. This product has only like 8 temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle. For example when I set 160°C then it is burning toasts and onions... When I set one step lower it is 130°C and it is not enough for frying :(((.Also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware. And even when I invest to expensive Tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges... You can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle, and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside :((( The pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so I\\'m sure the fault is in this philips stove... You can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom... Also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed :((( And even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse... Onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside... I\\'m really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove...There is one positive side and that is that heating is quick. My pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly. Faster than on gas stove. Also you can set time for like 10 minut and leave it which is quite convenient...Controll is easy. But I hate details. First I love one detail. There is \"pause\" button which is very cool. If something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat - It is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off, light up again and then find right flame again... Here you just press pause again and cook as before... But that is only thing that I love. Otherwise I hate how it is designed.... First basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless. Those buttons are preset temperatures. But anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook... Like there is \\'stirr fry\\' button and it set 180C. It totally burns onion... I set usually 180C for beginning and then soon change for 160C. But even 160C is too much burning... But lower setting is only 130C which is not frying at all. I would need like 150C I guess and it is impossible to set :((( ...Also I noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses. It heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like 10 seconds starts again. So instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off.But back to controll. Except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it won\\'t let you or let you to do only one \\'-\\' but not 2 times \\'-\\'. Why??? I don\\'t know probably ill will... You need to first press \"manual\" button which change temperature completely to 130C and only then you can freely press +/- and set your desired temperature. So basically I never use any preset mode and I always only press \\'manual\\' and +/- to set my temperature...Another control is setting time. I must say satting time is useful feature and I love it, but how it is implemented I hate. When you press time button then by default it set 30 minutes... Ok but when you hold \\'-\\' button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to 0 and roll to 3 hours.... Holding increment/decrement is so quick that it is useless. It must have implement some idiot... Anyway you can always click one by one. So to set 10 minutes you must click \\'time\\' button and then click 20 times \\'minus\\' button to set 10 minutes... It is doable but pretty annoying. Or I long press \\'-\\' it usially jumps directly to 3 hours and then I press 11 times +...  Still anoying but I save like 8 clicks... What is super idiotic is that when I want to add 5 minutes I click time and it by default set 30 minutes again :(((( Arrrrggghhhhh.... So instead of just click time and 5 times \\'+\\' I need to click 25 times \\'-\\' :((((.... Really this must have done some idiot.... Another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not... Imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like 3 seconds and not pressing \\'-\\'/\\'+\\' and then after those 3 seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again... When controlling  stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry :((((So over all I would buy anything else next time... Maybe it will be worse but I would at least try...Anyway to say something positive at the end I like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good. Packaging was also well. But power cable is only like 1.2 meters.... That might be too short... But for me just enough... Also I like mechanic buttons, some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but I like to feel the press and the click. Buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them. Cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat :) Cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stove...,Product is good but service center problem not available nearly.,No1,तेल गर्म करने में परेशानी,Ordered 3 one was faulty Recieved the package today . The product came intact .Upon opening the product saw some white powdery stuff all around the edges . Had to wipe it off and checked if all functions worked properly.It seems easy to use . And All functions worked good. There are dedicated options for even deep frying which some brands don\\'t have . Will update the review after using it for a while..,Good quality,Good product,Good Product 👍🏻,Good product,Works fine issue with delivery product bit damaged,Satisfied,Its timer functions is so easy 1. I have used it mainly for boiling water (knob turned maximum to right) so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings.2. It takes about 10 min for water to boil.3. Suggest Mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc (as I see some other kettles) .  It may add to the looks and give a warm feeling in the room.4. The stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but it\\'s ok for the price.  There may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in a C shape due to the C shaped half coil at base (funny design, maybe a product created by modifying a higher wattage full circular coil kettle).  The scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe.  They seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing.5. Given wide based cylinder shape, it is very easy to clean.To be aware: The kettle does not auto-shut off when water boils.  Similarly, the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off.  Else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating (I haven\\'t tested this though).  These are mentioned in the manual.  So this can be thought of as a warmer + boiler.  So you CANNOT leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil.  I assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.Accessories: Cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided.  Given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated, I would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way, e.g. steaming.  A steel rack is given, too.  That could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itself.Final verdict: If you are ok with a somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at a reasonable price, this will do the job.  If a similar product was available with higher wattage at a higher price, I would have bought that instead.,I wanted to give 1 star rating because Agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty. It is a bad practice. You cannot force customer to give rating. As I mentioned, it may result in the product having negative rating on Amazon despite being a good product.In my opinion the product itself is good. It heats water very fast. It is good for making Maggie, pasta, and boiling eggs. But need to be careful while making Maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottom.The kettle is very easy to clean.The cord length should have been longer.One issue that I noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heat.,Everything is good & it has been very useful for me. There is only one drawback; I guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever I boil milk or make tea/coffee, a portion of one side bunrs the milk. Even while boiling water I can see the similar symptom.,Agaro Multicooker is good and gives a variety of cooking/ boiling options like Milk, Tea, Eggs, Maggi, etc.Only negative point is that Agaro team promises extended warranty of 6 months by giving asking to give a positive review on Amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warranty.,Delivery has safe got item safely.Delivery on time, instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel students.Hope for warranty and company response.,I liked how fast it does the work but i hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something, it sticks their,Overall gorgeous product. The most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big. That is a better option for your kitchen and aslo that is the best option for hostel users.😅,Liked the design and operation. However cord length could be longer. Temperature control is good but knob need some modifications. Overall happy with this product. पहले भी 2 बजाज के रूम हीटर मैंने अमेजन से मंगवाए थे जो बजाज के पैकेजिंग डिब्बे को एक दूसरे बड़े अमेजन के डिब्बे में पैक करके आया था और सुरक्षित प्राप्त हुए। इस बार सीधे ही बजाज के डिब्बे पे  एड्रेस चिपका के भेज दिया मेरे पास आने तक डिब्बा कई जगह से फट गया था  प्लीज पैकिंग को पुनः एक और डिब्बे में करके भेजे,Nice products,Good product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/81xVUFEVuIL._SY88.jpg,,Less heating according to the price.,Works well, has been using it from a month for Bangalore like temperature in winters.

Disadvantage is its max temperature range it could attain is less I feel. But never got a burnt sandwich with this one.,All are good ...only you need to take care about heat and cutoff time of light...otherwise your sandwich will burn,it\\'s a very nice product even  though  the temperature control is  not  that great you have to preheat it before the  cord  is too big for my liking  but it\\'s fine there are some cons its top gets very heated when u are using it,u have to preheat it, it takes time to cool which is a big thing overall product is fit 7/10 would recommend so it would be 5 stars if it had nice  temperature  control the grill overall is nice but they  could improve and  a huge thing the lights given above it turn red and yellow it should be  green since yellow means waiting and stuff and in the beginning I thought the same thing and my sandwich burned the  wires at the back get heated up as well which can cause fire and is dangerous,We are useeing currently this product,As per accepted this is Good product,Nice,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612Pw1eVGqL._SY88.jpg Good press,Nice product,Good,Yes,It is a use and throw product.It can be used for 2-3 years.it can\\'t be repaired properly.,Good product,I liked the product, color, temp control, modes like silk, cotton and more, light weight good wire quality.,In this budget segment orient iron is very fine.Heating is fast.Temperature control knob is good.

I could feel the room gets warm in 1 hr. Blowing hot air can be felt upto 4 ft. It comes with 15A plug.

Who have pet this is not the one.,I like it very much.,Working good but need to do some improvement,It\\'s all gone. Wow. This electric device just cleans the lint so easily as if I would know what to do. An extra blade is just an icing on the cake.  Just pick any type of cloth and it just scrapes anything extra over them.,this is specially winter product...it have very sharp blades which easily removes the lints or rolled wollen materials.

I would say decent product,  easy to use only thing is temperature control could be little better compared to Phillips and pressing needs more weight to be applied compared to Phillips.,It very good product and reliability. Almost iam using more than 4 months,Nice product,I am happy with this great quality product,Gud in budget,Product is good but price is much greater,It\\'s good..,Nice product पैसा वसूल,Goid,Product is not working properly,green light not blinking,Time required for getting hot is more and please provide fastners along to this gyser,Value of money,25 liter Shakthi Neo Cost Rs6k :- Initially it took 30 - 45 mins to heat the water.  Now its taking 15 to 30 mins.Recommended to install through the brand and they charge Rs200.Working fine. This is the second water heater. Earlier one also Bajaj and  I\\'m using from past 8 years. Still working good.,Heating time is quite longer than other geysers. Especially in peak. Cold it will take 15-20 mins.Installation should be provided.,Good Useful for dark colour n delicate dress,What an amazing product. Was quite sceptical before buying it after reading all these mixed reviews but glad i did.Smoothens out the creases from dresses, coats, woollens and any fabric which is otherwise non iron-able. Of course, you can’t expect it to crease out the cotton shirts but It is a very handy product, especially if you are travelling. Also, the steam sanitises the clothes making them odour free.The water tank is small and needs to be re-filled again after about 2 clothes but bigger tank would have made it heavy and difficult to operate.Overall, good purchase.,Loving this product while using,It does the job pretty well.The cons according to me are 1. You cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces. Because the water doesn’t reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty. The alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to a cloth hanger and then use the steamer.2. Be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin. Keep you palm at a safe distance while steaming the dress. This may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses.3. Not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free.4. It sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches. The garment feels wet after using the steamer.5. You have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one top.,Easy to use, sturdy, and does the job, only thing is that it takes time to cool, rest of all good,Its an amazing product and easy to use. Just hang the cloth somewhere and start using this.,Great product..easy to carry..foldable...and results great,An average product but the cost is too high as it doesn’t completely satisfy your purpose. If u have to heat a small room you can definitely use this heater but people need to be near it to feel the heat.,Product is nice and better only when you are close to it. It can\\'t cool the small room atle,It is value for money and worth buying product, best build quality in this price range,The nice product and light weight very easy usable product,Good product value for money,I received the room heater it\\'s really very good 😁,This is Very good product,It’s good for smaller space. Okay, I have to say the following 5 things.1. Quite noisy, but not much, not at the level where your land lord will come down and tell you to keep the noise down.2. Lock is good and easy to clean.3. Plastic quality is good.4. Handy and easy too use.5. Do not make it grind or blend for more than a minute in a single stretch, the motor will start smoking.,I have a small kitchen, so this is just perfect for me as it requires very less space on my countertop. Using it for the last 2 weeks and I am happy with its grinding capacity, design and blending performance so far. I prefer making small batches of homemade spices and baby food cereals so it\\'s a very good option for me. It is  a good choice for powdering small quantities of spices. It comes with 2 blades- onefor grinding and the other for extraction. The extraction blade is suitable for making smoothies.,To start with, the look is very stylish and trendy! I use it for smoothies, milkshakes everyday...it is very convenient for everyday use since its very quick, for portion size use, cleaning is also very simple..Lock mechanism is amazing, and grinding technology is fascinating, just fix rotate and it starts grinding!..only disadvantage is the noise it makes while initial grinding,The product is quite nice and very compact. Firstly I faced issue while starting the Nutri blender as it didn\\'t start on it\\'s own, I need to hold it tightly then it started to run. Otherwise the product is good overall.,It is good for grinding and blending for small quantities.It is easy to use .Cleaning is also easy .It is best for making juices,smoothies and all types of chutneys. I do my cooking my cooking work fast with the help of this product as it takes less time to chop .I recommended this product,Product size is small but product quality is not good I used this product for 3 months and problems have arrived soon. Sometimes the blender doesn\\'t work and all the time some black grease like substance keep coming out and get mixed with food.,Like it and recommend it,Small jar not working ..... Bought for as my travel tool to easy ironing,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/618k+pbSNxL._SY88.jpg,Good product with good quality.,Nice,Good,Light weight,Good according to price ok. 1200,VfM I bought this item about one year ago.  Still working without any problem.  The only problem is with cord .wire.  the  length of the cord is very small.  so we have to use one extension box.,Nice product,Everything OK...but it has some metallic smell even after using for 2 weeks...cord length is same as many brands,Very helpfull with this product in the morning time.,Worth for money,Cord is super short and needs to be kept at a certain height from the power point, kettle heats up water very quickly, very useful for our needs,Value for Money it’s worthy,Button got defected after a year so we changed it otherwise its good only Amazon delivery was prompt and on time, (received next day off ordering not even 24hr, 5 star for amazon and delivery ) product packing was very good. Guys product is good but you need to find your own ways to instalation. For installation we had to call the customer service of Crompton where in they registered the request and they provide the third-party installation team number for the specific area where in we have to call for installation, they picked up the call registered the installation request and updated us they will call us back in 5 minutes to confirm the installation time but there was no call back for two days and when we called back many times they don\\'t even bother to pick up the call but they were promptly disconnecting the call. Company needs to check the credibility of service provider and take appropriate action otherwise brand popularity will go for a toss. Hope company takes appropriate action.,Pathetic installation service from Crompton. Had to call them multiple times before assigning a mechanic . The mechanic who came had 0 knowledge about installation or the machine. Worried what they would provide in case of breakdown or machine malfunction. Would suggest users to think about the cons before purchase. Product is average nothing too exceptional to write about. Will suit you good enough not excellent.,Is Good To use but What i Observed is that Its heats The water at 80℃  Only ~Not~  more than its not that Hot to mix But Its Good If Heat and Ready to bath. ..  It takes Around 12 min to heat Good to Bath In winter,Invoice should have been given inside the cartoon for problem in future,if any, with the geyser .,Takes more time to get hot water,Good performance,Good product,Fast heating that was good ... I recently recived the product and have used only once, so review is basis that.Looks wise very sleek product and looks sturdy. Has a rubberised platform so that it doesnt move much when in motion.Works as expectedThis is more convenient in comparison to the handheld chopper which breaks easily. Borosil chopper has 2 year warranty as well so thats a plus.Will update as i use it more,Warranty bill card not available inside the package,Didn\\'t get the whisking blade. Amazon has only the option to return the product. The product is good hence I only want the whisking blade sent to me.,Finally, i found the right box among multple amazon parcels I received and my neighbour handed over to me and it is perfectly working borosil electric chopper which is must have.,I was looking for a durable and best chopper. Borosil make best products. I am using other borosil electronics for years and they are just great.This copper chop the veggies within 5 sec and outcome is just awesome. Go for it without any second thought.,I liked this product. Chops even ginger in seconds.Made my cooking easier. The vegetables are chopped in even small sizes and can be added to chila or Paratha or even dosa flour for healthy diet for children.If you plan to buy one, go for it.,Very nice product but not everyday use for small family.Good for big family for every day use,Cooking doesn\\'t take much an effort but prep times do. Relishing an easy peasy kitchen life with this wonderful utility kitchen must-have. Very impressed. Product is good but now price is increased  I was brought it for 1099 and now it\\'s price is 1199 with in 15 days,Good,Must buy,Nice looking or good control heart,Night,Electric Wire is too short..It should be expanded for easy of use.....,Good performance,Nice product Purchaseed a couple of months back. So far it is good. When my daughter purchased a year back, recently there was motor problem which was replaced under warranty.,Product is good quality. Worth buying it,Well it is easy to use and less noisy. It comes with 750W of motor. So it provides more energy and grind in less time.,Only juicer jar 🏺 is not good and other jar 🏺 very good design average product good 👍,Good products,Create too much noise, overall good product,Mixer se tak tak hilane pe aawaj aata hai,Daal ko pisne ke liye Kiya It is very easy to use and egg get boiled within 15min. It is portable and easy to carry and cook 7eggs in one time. even design and Quality of the product is nice. amazing product in less money. Thanks Amazon 😊,Good to use. Egg boiled properly. The only thing wrong colored product is delivered but thats ok. I will manage.,Amazing product with automatic off facility. Easy to use and time efficient. Must try it,Good product,Just improve quality and working is very good.,It works really good, it\\'s been a month now using this boiler and it works fine till date. Things to make note of: 1) When you boil keeping all 7 eggs at a time, there\\'re chances of slight breaking of 1 or 2 eggs which in my case but works fine if you try with 6 or 5 or lesser no. 2) The wire is short so you\\'ll need to have plug point nearer to the base or use a stool. 3) The boiled eggs are slight softer(whites) than the usual eggs that are boiled on stove but you\\'ll get accoustemed to it. 4) Can be used only to boil eggs and frying directly is not working. 5) Measuring cup is provided and can be used to measure water for soft, medium or hard boiling of eggs,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71-aTgWX3dL._SY88.jpg,It\\'s very convenient to boil the eggs. Good for everyday use. Only problem is the wire is very very short, just 1ft, it makes bit tricky to use, as you need to put something below so that the plug could reach the socket, atleast they should have provided 1mtr length wire.Cleaning is easy but as it has air openings at bottom you need to carefully wash it. It\\'s working,Good,Good Product 👍,Nice product,Cant use for long hours. Good for small rooms and can be used for a minimum amount of time.,Not sure if I can use overnight.,Nice bad high price,Please don\\'t bye it, I ordered this Amazon basics room heater, it running well for two months and suddenly stop working when I want to claim my 1 year warrenty, their customer card service is really sucks, when I called customer service, first it is told that \" You have to register warrenty first \" Then I register my warrenty and it takes 3 days to register and then I apply for my warrenty, they told me to email at Amazon brand email, and now such disaster started, they told me on email it takes 7 days to process my warrenty, and till date 24 days from my complain register, and i don\\'t get my warrenty till date, so please don\\'t bye it....... Nice product,Small and handy!,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Bw5+wCBHL._SY88.jpg,Received the product with pressure stains on it otherwise the product is great.,Decent weighing scale, slightly on the smaller side but portable.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I6rWU9s4L._SY88.jpg,I received the product today and it is very light, and easy to use.,Everything like accuracy light weight and easy to use are fine but I return it on second day itself because of its size you can not understand why its so small than shown in on web.. very good looking product and value for money, only the water flow is very slow,You have to pay for installation,pipes n any additional taps which is required 😩,Quick warm water received, auto cut but increase in electricity bill,Nice product from bajaj. But installation charge is high. Rs 350 for bajaj installation service charge, 230 for connecting pipes and 120 for wall Hanging screws. Total 700rs.,Packaging contains main unit with 3 pin plug attached.Safety valve given.No inlet/outlet pipes given,no screw sets given for hanging the main unit.,Good efficient water heater.Installation expenses on higher side....Usually all appliance company gives free installation as the first intraction would be free always. I suggest you add the installation cost in the product and also give package price with hot and cold pipes so that installation technition don\\'t make merry.,Best geyser at best price from best company Bajaj. Got delivered within 3 days. Very good 10 ltr. storage geyser model at 5000/- which doesn\\'t include installation and pipes. For that 500 to 600 Rs has to be paid at the time of installation. Installation will be done on request through bajaj Helpline. Overall very good product by bajaj and best quality delivered by Amazon and it\\'s dealer.,worth for money Bosch TrueMixx Pro Mixer Grinder 1000 Watt-MGM8842MIN, BlackReview:I usually do not write reviews, but I felt I had to write this one, because when I was researching which mixer to buy I found really bad reviews that do not do justice to the product. I went with the trust on Bosch brand name and am extremely satisfied with the product. I have been using it daily, sometimes multiple times in a day for past month during lockdown period. I hope this will help others.Mixer includes +capacity -1 Mixer body1 Plastic blender jar 1500ml + fruit filter,1 Wet grinding jar 1500 ml1 Dry grinding jar 1000 ml1 Chutney grinding jar 400 ml1 extra Pounding Blade1 SpatulaBuild and overall appearance1. The mixer-grinder 1000 watt motor is extremely powerful.I have used it to grind both dry & wet ingredients such asgaram masala, idli/dosa mix, Chana dal paste, Poppy seeds paste,coconut chutney, dry rice and urad dal powder, ginger garlic paste, ice, etc.I regularly blend and make milk shakes, lassis etc and have found it to very fast and convenient.2. Does the job fast within few seconds/minutes depending on the amount and type of ingredients you are working with.3. Body is good looking, sturdy, well balanced and easy to wipe clean.4. The vacuum feet are quite secure and give a true hands free experience.5. Overload protector for added safety helps if you overload the mixer by mistake.6. The jars also are easy to use and quite well-builtJars & Blades1. The jars are metal with removable stainless steel blades.2. Chutney jar blade is fixed.3. An extra blade is provided for stone pounding affect.4. A spatula cum blade changer is provided.5. The Jar lids are made of transparent plastic.6. Each lid has a small top cap which can be removed to add liquids/materials while grinding/blending.7. Each lid has rubber gaskets. This gives a completely leak proof experience while grinding/blending. These gaskets are very easy to remove and attach.8. All Jars have 4 fibre clasps to close the jars.9. In the blender jar a juicer attachment has been provided – this is the only thing I have not used, hence I cannot review the performance of this attachment.10. Blender can be used without the juicer sieve, and works fine.11. In wet blender a flow-breaker is providedSoundSound is high, but that is to be expected in a powerful 1000 watt machine.Do’s & Don’tI feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product1. Do not overload2. Do not use for more than a minute without giving a little rest.3. When turning the speed knobs – don’t turn all at once from 0 to max. You will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly, staying at each speed for a few seconds. Actually for most things  low to medium speed is enough. The machine is really powerful.4. When grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up ( not the machine) so give a little rest in between.5. For wet grinding – use cold water to grind – that way the jar will never heat up.6. DO NOT grind hot ingredients. Many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting – that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground. Bring food to room temp and then grind.7. Wash the jar, gasket, jars immediately using a sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact.8. Always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets.9. In the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it.10. To remove fine particles when dry grinding don’t use a spoon to avoid scratches to the jar. You can use your hand and a brush ( used for this purpose only).11. This is an expensive piece of equipment – In my house only I & my husband use it. We do not allow  children or household help/cooks to use it. This way the machine will not be misused.12. If you mixer does not work  – please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine. Remove some of the ingredients and try again.13. Take care while handling jar lids and lid tops – Although they appear quite well made, I cannot say if they will break when dropped.Pros1. The machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises2. It is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience3. Easy to clean4. Grinds and blends everything5. Leak-proof lids.6. Takes very little time to grind7. The motor does not heat up even easily8. The overload protector works perfectlyCons1. Guarantee & Manual - The Manual has to be downloaded from the Amazon websiteThe Amazon payment is the guarantee. There is no separate guarantee card provided. I had to call Amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card.2. Delivery - The mixer-grinder came in a box but there was no special Styrofoam padding. This was a big minus for me.3. A couple of extra lid clasps should be provided – one of my lid clasps was loose, it is working fine at the moment, but as a backup company should provide these.4. As the jars are pretty large, for smaller amount of products it is a little difficult. I wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry & wet grinding rather than only wet.5. The jars do have screws heads on the inner side – but this is not a big deal – and can be cleaned quite easily.,Review after using for few monthsPros: The lock feature is really good for hands free usage. Grinds very fast. Say, half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than 4 minutes. Juicer is good, extraction is good for the juicy fruits. Good design and takes less space in kitchen.Cons: Noise is there for the power it grinds. But anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which I read before my purchase.Steel jars get heated up quickly. So I used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heat.Just need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt a little.(wet grinding jar)Tips- clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge. So that jars won\\'t loose it\\'s shine 🙂,I bought this Bosch mixer on 2020 and the motor is not working I have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such a big amount in it.it worked only for 2 years.it was only for household purpose i purchased.very much disappointed with a brand.Showed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside .,True to its name the Bosch Mixer Grinder is a great machine to have in your kitchen. However the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is a challenge.,NA,This is a very good product overall. The dosa/idli and other such batters come out excellent. The motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needs.The only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer. It works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus, oranges, watermelon, etc. But the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with a lower water content, the juicer fails at extracting anything. The juicer is basically another blender jar with a mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp. There is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush them.All in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juices.,I was a happy customer of Sujata for the past 10 years and Bosch was a a good optionGood design, powerfull motor , worth for the price i bought (5500 in offer ),It has a powerful motor, does grinding pretty fast. Compact size. Lid lock clip very useful. Priced high. Juicer function is not much useful. Just received, as of now looks good in this price range. Will use it for few months and update the review.,Batteries has leaked inside the packing. Had to put new ones,Wonderful scale, means great look, good accuracy, very lightweight and skinny and easy to store, and very easy to clean.So far so good, BUT:The \\'durable 304 stainless steel construction\\' is just a half true promise. Only the top plate is obviously some metal but the body is also obviously plastic.Would not even mind about this little deviation between promise and reality, we all know how marketing messages have to be read, but the durable stainless steel top plate fell apart from the remaining plastic part of the machine after not even 4 months of use. Seems it was simply somehow glued on top (with 4 glue strips), and the glue doesn\\'t work anymore due to whatever reason (didn\\'t remove it, it just fell apart during vertical storage, just so after only 4 months of use). Weighting still works when I press the metal plate correctly back on top but as soon as I store it, the plate separates itself again from the other part. Assembling that thing again and again for every single use is a pain i.t.a. and not what I expected.That\\'s why I give finally another brand a chance, after I complete my review. This time no more durable stainless steel construction wanted ... let me try a different construction, which is even some hundreds of bucks cheaper than this thing here (both prices 60% reduced today). If it keeps 5 months without breaking, it\\'s a good deal compared to this one, isn\\'t it?,Plastic,The product I received is good. Just started using it. Will update in the future about it\\'s pros and cons.,Easy to use,Good product,It is referred to me by my friend who is using it for months and he is very much sure about the accuracy of this and then he reffered to me very value for money Product is good and color full, completely lived it, go for it, very useful for everyone,No engineering. I wish they had come in good colours too.,These are working fine for light polythene bags but not suitable for the heavy grade plastic bags. It gets the job done. The plastic’s showing deformation in the hinge part. So worried about the life of this product.,Value for money and quality is also good,Very useful,The quality of the product says durability, not very good looking but the clips do their job well. Easier and much economical then buying boxes.... Good Product a must buy from Amazon....,Nice product,Product is overall good May be built slightly heavy in design for better look and air delivery. Overall satisfied in the price of around 1400/-.,This product is excellent with given price and performance is cool.,Amazing fan quality is good awesome speed,The product discription says 400rpm but its a 380rpm fan,Bit of sound. Nonetheless a good product overall.,Very nice👍👏👏,Value for money,Installation parts are not adequate and make clicking sound in low speed (anything below full speed.

I have bye this room heater on January 2022. And in December 2022 one rod has stopped. I have complaint to Maharaja customer care, they refused to change the rod free of cost. They are saying that rod is not under warranty. Only Box is under warranty. Maharaja is a cheater company.,The concern first,base of the heater is made of plastic and plastic base needs to be screwed with the metallic heater body with 2 screws. Since heater body is metallic, tall and has weight, the connection with plastic base doesn\\'t feel robust/durable enough as it shakes when touched.Else all looks good and rest depends on how long it lasts.,The stand needs to be more sturdy as it leans back on flat surface. Otherwise this is a good product for a 15x15 ft room @1200W.

The trigger of the water spray gun has to be pushed continuously during use. It would have been nice if there was a device that could hold the trigger.5.

Information in the manual is not enough.,I liked the power it generates.. mindblowing power from this machine which just costs under 5000!!!I used it just today.. noticed a bit heat produced from the motor.. not sure if that is common...

It helps to keep the place really warm,Very good product in winter for kids and much more,All ecectric devices are prone to damages and faults, but it should be possible to be repaired. Unfortunately this product doesn\\'t have that option and my purchase went for a complete waste.,First things firstIt\\'s not bad heater and it provides plenty of warmth.However, the unit I received had one major, or rather fatal, issue. Current was passing through its entire body, be it the front grill or the area near the handle in the back. You can\\'t hold it without getting an electric shock when it\\'s running. If you have to turn the knob or simply move it from one position to another, you would need to unplug it from the power source first. Otherwise it can be fatal. If you use it in the night, you have to keep it out of your reach otherwise if you wake up at night to drinking water or anything else, you might accidentally touch it and die. Homes with children needs to be extra protective.Now I am not sure whether this fault is only in my unit or a general problem with these type of heaters. I have requested a replacement, let\\'s see how the replacement unit works. I\\'ll update the review accordingly.,in my heater one rod is not working then i call the bajaj customer care number it is given in pamphlet then a person came from bajaj and my issue solved Speed is gud nd easy to handle,Very useful,Quality is okay for this price.,Ok,Good product,Nice product,Is is easy to use and we can use it for everything.It is orerall great 👍,I bought it in 2019, using it everyday.

If it is still in market, i would highly recommend. https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FwgWAcaHL._SY88.jpg,It doesn\\'t occupied more space easy to kept any where but wire length i feel bad bcz it is too short.,I like many things of this product like quality, colour,easy to use and most important thing is in my budget,Value for Money any one can buy and  satisfy the product,Very useful product thank Amazon,Good product easy to use,Shape and product looks nice.,Well , i am using your EGG POACHER . After using it extensively for many days i would like to say that it is a perfect device to boil eggs . At this cost i\\'d never expected this kind of excellent product quality .I am really satisfied with this product and looking forward to buy another for my brother .I suggest everyone to go for it without doubt . It has a option of extended warranty for 6 months. Related to packaging I am little disappointed because I was not able to make out of its new or used product. I just made sure there are no scratches on the product. It didn\\'t come in Amazon box though.,The product is use to use and very light weight. The bowl is an add-on and the scale can be used without it as well.,Amazing product... good accuracy...easy to carry everywhere..just need some improvements on weighing liquid in ml because only water\\'s ml is equal to gm but rest of the liquid have their own density but this machine still show same ml to gm..,Touch works fine.,The machine does a really good job with good precision. It’s also light weight and quite easy to handle. But it’s a little bit overpriced,Very compact and easy to use scale. It even has multiple units and backlight.,Using it in day to day kitchen for recipes.I like it very much.,Liked the Product Bit time consuming compared to traditional oil frying. Fry meats and vegetables without any oil. Even prepare fryums without oil.,Nice product. Philips quality has always been outstanding. Yes, for Indian household, some R&D is needed for suitable recipes. But the results are amazing. Almost zero oil and almost same taste. Quite an healthy option for all health-conscious people,Can bake some dishes with less oil. Some chicken fry dishes can be cooked in this. Its great for French frys.,Yet another good product from Philips, best in quality in this price range & capacity,I cooked fries, brushed a little oil over them and the result was amazing. Very good product for mid aged people to stay healthy and enjoy everything in food. I am 40. Hope to Cook more good food and post more videos. Go for it.,Nice product!

Browns bread evenly. Pop up works fine. The cord is too short. Have to keep the toaster on an inverted vessel to reach the plug point,Bought this after returning bajaj qtr-3 immediately after unboxing due to build quality issues.I have no regrets on my decision  of returning the Desi one for this international beauty.Build quality and looks are just superb. One improvement could be inclusion of an LED indicator.By the way, it has two knobs- one for toast and one for grill. Overall it\\'s bang for buck,Would recommend,Everything,Sometimes the bread gests toasted nice on highest heat, sometimes burns. But toaster looks good and easy to use.,Nice product,Good product. Bun warming feature looks useful. Temperature control works well,Wonderful product 👍 Since I have just started using, I find it a good product.,Good quality,,Very handy, light portable and safe heater. Each rod consumes only 400 Watt of power, so you may take the risk of keeping it on with one rod on for hours together with out the risk of over heating of cable, MCB breakdown or fire. It can be plugged in a five ampere ordinary domestic socket without 15 ampere power supply.,very nice,Like,Reflector is not Stainless Steel make and hence description in the web does not match.

Engg and CROMPTON has been alreay made great name in motors, pumps Seller: Cloudtail India Private LimitedPrice: 2200/- (Price can drop as low as 1700/-)Delivery: One day, Prime, BangalorePackage: Big carton box with air pack, No damageRecommended: YesReturnable: YESRoom Heaters, which one do you need?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Before my review, I will let you know which one should you buy. An oil heater is best that you can buy, but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than 3 months and well below 10 deg. For normal winter uses, I recommend buying Convection type heaters with fan and Thermostat. Please avoid conduction based ones (They can consume less power, cheap but they are very slow, plus burns oxygen). Also note, whichever you buy make sure it has a Thermostat setting!Product Review:~~~~~~~~~~~~~This product from USHA is a convection type room heater, and I have listed the below features and information.♦ Twin Blade fan♦ Thermostat built-in (Like AC, will turn on/off as per temp changes)♦ 1000W/2000W operation (2000W means faster heating)♦ Fan only mode for normal table fan type! (Can\\'t adjust speed/ ON-OFF)♦ Power LED when it operates♦ Fan noise is high and a bit annoying if your room is very calm♦ 15A Power plug and 1m cord length♦ Retracting stand to elevate height about 2 inches♦ 1 year warranty for the productThe room heater uses a powerful fan to spread the heat. No Swing option, very directional. You must position it correctly and securely. The Thermostat option is good to have, and I suggest buyers to buy with thermostat, as this will help reduce your EB bills, as well as give comfortable weather inside. The thermostat is not very accurate, like in Air conditioners but works. The user manual gives clear information about using it.How to set up?~~~~~~~~~~~♠ Power on, select 1000w/2000w (The switch is not easy to operate)♠ Set to thermostat switch to MAX (Anti-clockwise)♠ Let the heater run till you feel comfortable (Warm inside)♠ Reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off♠ Leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater ON till morning--> Note, if you have mistakenly set it wrongly, turn-off and turn-on. Once again follow the same step above.I use this for my sleeping room which is about 12x12 size. In Bangalore, it is about 20-21 deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks, and it took about 20-30 minutes to bring it 26-27 deg with 1000w in almost closed room. Please note, if your place has a room temperature (Not outside temp) well below and it not exposed to sunlight, then it will take a long time to reach comfortable temperature. In such cases only use 2000 W setting. It does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness, so keeping a bucket or a better a tray of water will help. But you must keep your window slightly open, never use it on a closed room.5A or 15A?~~~~~~~~I see this as a main problem, as in many of our houses, we only have 15A for Washing machines and AC socket which is not easily reachable. This unit can only be plugged into 15A socket. The reason is, when you operate a 230v, unit with 5A socket, you can only draw a maximum of 1150 Watts (230v x 5A) from that socket. However, since this unit operates also at 2000W, it requires 15A, as that could only provide up to ~3000W (230v x 15A) like ACs, etc. However, you can safely use this unit from a normal 5A socket ONLY IF YOU ARE USING AT 1000W ALWAYS. Just buy a 5A to 15A converter socket and use this. Do not worry, it will work just fine, but never use 2000W though (If you house has MCB Tripper, then it\\'s much safe).Tips:~~~~>> Always keep some space from all 4 sides of the heater unit>> First try with fan unit for 10 minutes before using for heater (Using after a long storage )>> Keep a window slightly open for fresh air>> Air can feel dry after sometime, can cause nose irritation and dryness. Room must be ventilated, adding water tray can helpDrawbacks:~~~~~~~~1. Fan noise, sometimes unbearable in a calm room2. Average Build quality and finishingFinal words:~~~~~~~~~I recommend this product, a cheap and effective unit for a small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen, but makes dry air which can easily be overcome. The prices could drop around 1700/- sometimes, so please check price before buying. Thanks for reading this, if you have any doubts, comment below.,On first Day , I had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues. I am happy on this product 😃😊.,Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GxDSyE-yL._SY88.jpg,Hi,I purchased this Usha 812T heater which got delivered to me on 29th Dec 21. We use it moderately for just 3-4 hrs in day.It was working fine for 18 days. However,on 19th day i.e on 16Jan22 night, after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making \\'khad,khad,khad...\\' sound and all its coil were red hot. Since we were awake, I just switched off the power from main switch. It could have resulted into burning or fire, if I would have delayed for few more seconds.When I picked up the heater in hand, it looked some part was loosened inside.Then on the next day, on 17th Jan 22, I lodged a complaint with Usha customer care, na di was told the technician will visit within 48hrs. However, no one came in 48 hrs. So I called up the technician on the number shared to me by Usha on 19th. After that technician visited me. Upon checking he found that out of 2 fans, one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside, that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heated.I was relaxed that it\\'s not a big problem and would be fixed quickly. But to my surprise, the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed, is not able to hold the screw tightly. There was a problem with the coupler. What kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymore?Adding to my surprise, the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement. He said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available. But he didn\\'t came back. When I called next day, he said part is not available and has informed the company, but can\\'t say when it will be available.So I called Usha customer care again, and they said \"yes techinician has reported part is not available\" na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asap.Since then I have been calling Usha Customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each other.Usha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced. I asked them how many days it may take as I can\\'t keep on waiting for a month, they just said they can\\'t say when it would be available.Since it is too cold nowadays, and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this Usha heater.If they will replace it after a month, winter would have already passed by then.This is a worst after sale service from big brand like Usha, and it was not expected from Usha. If they don\\'t have the basic parts available with the service center, what is the use of sending technician empty handed?From now on, I will never recommend Usha to anyone, and if any Usha representative is reading this post, I request to them to service my heater asap.Thanks,Go ahead 🤩,The cord is very short and required 16 amp plug point. It eats up available oxygen in closed room,Using since one year , found fit for house use. The mixier is very asthetically designed and performs well. I am very much satisfied and would definitely recommend this machine to all potential buyers,Usability,I liked this product but one thing is that there is no light indicater of electricity on/off so,its little bit confusing that wheather it\\'s on or off.,Good product....,The package was not done with Amazon packaging but like a gunny bag type pack.  Not expected. Very poorly haphazard packing.  Will any body look into this?,Keep in mind it makes quite noticeable amount of noise. And after using it for more than 2 years. One of the utensils rotor broke and start making more noise. Other than that a good purchase. And good modern design.,Good,Lid of small jug very loose good product,It looks decent, has decent space and serves the overall purpose.,Good products size could be little big,Good in quality.,Its about knee length height. The ring at the top is broken inside the loop. Otherwise it is very good. Need to check for durability,Handle Material is so much good. The stritching is not tight in some sides it will get loose in few weeks. If u buy, u have to once again make stritching then the durability is longer..,Good,The bag is worth the costing however the picture gets a little misleading as it\\'s not as sturdy as shown in the pictures & the capacity is also not much. A very handy bet in case if we are trying to get something in pocket friendly price. i am a student, I needed it to carry abroad. I didn\\'t found any other portable mixer in lighter weight.

Then heavy noise occurs.Otherwise goodone.,I am using for last one month, its very good product for average use,Good productI give rating 10/9 Ikea sales this product for 99/- only. It\\'s not worth more than that. Quality is not top notch. At first I thought orginal product was replaced with first copy. But after doing some research got to know, it was orginal product costing 99/- only directly from ikea. Seller I guess buys from ikea and sale here. Coz the MRP tag was removed.,I have tried many frothers, but this is the best one so far since I finally found one where the steel rod does not fall off.,They should have given one set of battery with the item. These batteries are not easily available and my frother is lying useless in my kitchen.,bad product broken,The product suddenly stopped working completely today after about 4 months. The speed had deteriorated after one month of use.I use this product sparingly - about once every few days for frothing three / four cups of coffee. Hence, there is no reason for this to malfunction. There is also no recourse available to me,Average quality,,This product is not powerful enough. Value for money,No likes no dislikesValue for money,Plug needed am adaptor,The element is heating too much , need to shut down each time . The product is beautiful designed but quality wise crompton greaves has comprised:The basic feature of any heat convector is element if it is getting heat up 🔝 then it’s broke down,It\\'s to good ☺️,Value for money....,Plug is too large for this type of plug you have should have 16 amp socket board, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/711EJ0kjZvL._SY88.jpg,I like this is handy and easy to use.For multiple clothes it\\'s got stop in between.,Was looking for this only.

Heating happens on one side of the vessel only. Heating is not distributed around the center of vessel. Hence milk stains happens only on one side of the vessel. Refer image.2. During cleaning water may go inside the temperature control knob. So washing should be carefully done.The above points should be considered for better design of the Kettle.,There is no flame adjustment I usually don\\'t write review but this product is amazing everyone should give it a try , u will not disappoint after buying....,No words to say. Amazing👍😍🤩 you can see the picture I hv shared. The main concern is power cord length. It is too small. Overall finish is good. Functionally it is ok. Thick piece of bread can be toasted.,Good,The only reason I bought this product is it\\'s country of origin is India as compared to its competitors. But they have mentioned it wrong in the description. I\\'m not complaining the product but they should have mentioned correct information,Book,Browning settings are done very well. Rating has been given for this price point. Well worth the price,Nice product easy n safe,Nice performance. Have used 2 of them. Cleaning up is difficult though.,Toasting up to mark Hi, I used this 13fin heater in a 12x 14 feet room with roof hight at 10ft.It tood 1 hr 30 minutes to raise temperature by 2 degree( from 14.4 to 16.5. Room was closed.I retirmed it. Bought Black+Decker 11 fin which is too fast and surpass this bajaj 13fin.,Bajaj name in itself a guarantee of excellence. A very product. Heats up the house in no time. Like a boon to elderly people like us,This is my review after 3 days of usage. Firstly I feel I got a used product as the packing was already unpacked inside the box and normally with a brand new unused oil heater, on first usage you get a smell as the oil and fins heat up for first time. This did not happen for me. Anyways I just thought to see if all is good and hope it performs.The heater has very very slow heating. You need to run it at max thermostat and with full load 2500 or 2900 W and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth. I was able to touch the fins for a second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off. Thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and on.For such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often. If you have doors opening every now and then, it will not keep room warm.Over all for the price it has I didn\\'t feel like its worth to operate it when it has so slow heating.,This clearly is one of the best oil heater out there at a very good price. In offline i was getting 13 fin model for 12k to 13k, but here at Amazon i got it at Rs. 9799. This is very silent and heats up the room in 20 to 30 min.,Really worth for the money spent. Easy to use and can be moved to other rooms without any difficulty. The performance is good.,The product is good but the desired product was not delivered,I am happy with my decision to buy this heater. Room gets warm and comfy .,The radiator works very well even in the cold Kullu weather. Has 2 heat settings and when you’ve turned it on for a while, you can turn the heat settings off and the fan will still blow warm air. Very effective and doesn’t give you headache like the rod heaters do. Has auto cutoff as well. I like this. Value for money compared to other company overall is good product.,Good product that is value for money.,Not that high speed as shown in videos not satisfy with the speed over all its easy to use easy to install,The product mechanism is like any other exhaust fan in the market. I realized that the size of the exhaust fan doesn’t really have a noticeable impact on suction power of air.Nonetheless, its drawbacks are that because of the small space between the fan blades, it is ultimately impossible to clean any dust/oil buildups on the inside rods and the shutter walls. The only way to clean the aforementioned areas is from the posterior side of the exhaust fan, which is difficult to reach in most housing situations.,Ok,Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71MjXiO1DoL._SY88.jpg,Decent quality and works as per my requirement, not that great. The product really looks good and classy unless it was not damaged,The kettle looks sleek but there seem to be some design defects. The base and the bottle dont seem to fit exactly so that the entire contraction wobbles about when the water starts boiling. Then while pouring, hot steam which enters the handle thru the steam sensor hole makes the handle too hot. i had to tape the handle to insulate my hand from the hot handle. The switch doesn\\'t fit the slot on the handle perfectly and i also noticed some water drops condensing on the inside of the switch on the handle.I used a Prestige kettle earlier which had much better workmanship. But these are all made in China anyway. i have nothing against China, here with the Wipro kettle there seems to have been a bad lot which possibly explains why the price is lower than that of other models offered by Wipro.This is a problem with shopping on Amazon that one gets sucked into price comparisons and going for the cheaper option which are mostly defective products without any disclaimer. In this case, i consciously went for this option on the hope that it would not be a serious defect. Lets see if my hope is allayed.,It\\'s too good and using it for.more than 6 months now,Nice product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P0bAv1bAL._SY88.jpg,Easy to use, as simple as 123,The product is good but it makes too much noise while heating,It\\'s an Ok product but price is little high ,same things same features u will gey on some brands at cheaper price ,lets see how long itTill now working perfectly. Coffee Filter is just the right size for a small family. It has a good finish and is easy to wash and clean.,The size is compact, good for making a strong filtered coffee for 2 pax, what else do you expect?, just go for it!!,Use it everyday . No complaints,Easy to use and maintain+clean. Size could have been bigger. Overall good for one person.,You can get it for less price than this in a retail shop! Or even in Big Bazaar,It\\'s compact, easy to use and makes a great cup of coffee.,GOOD COFFEE FILTER,Simple product. Works well. The filter holes could have been smaller- decoction goes down in a minute, and does not get the strength. Probably I should go to a grinder and ask for coarse grinding of the coffee beans. It is Okay so far.,This product was amazing and easy to use.,Have used this previouslyRepeat order.Different sizes  make it use for various pantry items.,Good, its Useful.,I like this products for a long time when we were in London. Good quality products.,A life saver when you run out of containers. not too sturdy like the one you get in MINISO, but not bad either.,Quality is pretty good at an affordable price,These are good solid and sturdy clips. The clips are in 2 sizes, 1 quite big and can easily clip big packets, but the other are half the size and somewhat small. It would have been good to include some medium sized clips which I find most useful... Neither too big nor too small. But overall, good quality and sturdy, hence 4 stars. The battery was not fitting,This time the filters have some change in design and filter the water faster, I don\\'t understand why Amazon sent it with direct item pack instead of packing,Good , regular and useful product,The product quality is going down day by day,Good,product packing is not at all professional its not all expected from a reputed brand like HUL,Nice,not good product Nice product, value of money,Nice,I have received the product with broken seal. Otherwise purchase is ok.,100%,Nice,Good,Super super super super,Good Juicer is not effective,Ok good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61Z62He3yyL._SY88.jpg,Didn\\'t expect a prestige product to stop working within 2 months of buying. Coupler isn\\'t rotating. Tried to reset. Still not working. What a waste of money from this brand,Nice,Good qualityWorth to buy it,Easy use and clean but it\\'s very noisy cannot use if you have small baby that\\'ll wake them up if they\\'re sleeping,Motor sound heavy Good buy and great deal,I prefer,  they should have gave an option to remove the blade.  Because,  cleaning will be easy.  Otherwise,  product is good,Good,Good product,Allready  used this productVery nice,Good,It\\'s been 2 months we have brought the item and so far there are no issues found with grinding or cleaning. Noise level is manageable.,Good Not Bad, Not good,,Takes 12 mins to make it hard boil all eggs.Can also be used to steam Momos,All in it is good,Good,Very comfortable and stylish product,Lid is not fitted to the product,Quality of item is good.,Overall an OK product, but auto-cut stopped working after 7 days and light also do not work properly. So you have to be cautious and wait for time. Superb,,Easy to use and low sound hearing good look,Value of the money,Good product,Fine grinding,Nice product,Good It is big to travelling purpose other wise it is good,If you travelling out side with your baby then it will best option for you to take it and use it for hot water and khechadi.Also you can make itili on this.One minor concern is this product is sensitive to water, it means if want to cook food without water then it will torn off automatically.For example if I want cook some fried thing then i should use oil first then at that moment it will not work because you used oil.So you cannot fry anything on it.Only you can do using water. Everything that can be done by using that be done using it.So keep this thing on your mind while purchasing this item.Apart form this everything works great.,उपरोक्त,It is good for small family and easy to clean.pl.provide at least 2 Meier cord for immediate use and mak  eplace for 360 movement cord.,Size is very small...,I think it\\'s a good product,I had to return it, because off size, it\\'s very small and I doubt it\\'s useful for rice cooking, it\\'s good for steaming and boiling,Not wasy to use and quality of moulds etc is really bad...Complicated process of how much water to fillNo Clear instructions on cooking, I have been using this for about six months now. It is quite handy and is able to make pretty good fruit shakes and smoothies. I add a couple of ice cubes and it manages to crush them, but needs more than one cycle. Battery life is acceptable, I charge after every 5-6 uses. The motor runs at full all the time, I thought that I would be able to tell when the battery gets low but no, it will simply stop at the last second with no way to tell if it is getting low. Initially I wondered if the exposed charging port would lead to any problems or not, but I have been careful with it and have had no issues.I find it to be a great and useful product for one person. Get a proper non-portable blender if you want to use it for blending hard, dry substances, or for multiple people.,Easy to use,Best Blender used so far,Great product. Very compact and easy to carry. Can’t blend hard items but works for soft fruit smoothies or milkshakes. We liked this product,Build is solid. And the motor is powerful enough for its purpose. It would have been perfect if the charging port was not exposed.,Good oneSatisfied,I am using this product since 2weeks.It is good upto now. I am using this for only milk shake with banana only.its blending is good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/61yaKvhqNSL._SY88.jpg Good product for basic dry ironing and a must have for every house-hold. Temperature ccontrol is not that great and could have been a knob instead of a circular disc that everyone makes. Innovation? Overall I would recommend thsi product as it does all your basic dry ironing and better than philips I bogutht sometime back that has a sharp steel edge that kind of rips soft clothes. I recommend Usha.,I had previously purchased on 2018 it was running fine from last 4 years and I got job in a different place do I have ordered again, Worth for money.,Worth for money,Good Product in this price range. However, I recevied a bit damaged product at the handle. Throug, I fixed it & using it.,Very good product,It\\'s Amazing product in this price range....quality is good also look good..easy to use and overall good product.........,Good,Product is not heating aa per expectations and therefore not ironing well Good product,Everything is okay but it’s increasing heat at working.,What I observe in few days to use with this Kent hand blender that is very sleek design and well built with steel body and there is some issues with this. It is become very hot in 15 minute of continuous run that hot u can\\'t even touch that and there push button you have to continuous press button to run.,Easy to handle and comparatively nice blender then others.Decent price,Best Kent product,easy to clean,Having been using this for 6 months working as per standard and it is easy to clean. But getting over heared if we use for more than 5 min. And the cooling time is more.,Seller should check the item before shipping it will reduce the negetive feedback and also return shipping extra charge will b reduced to them.no one is going to take defective product. Very useful product and value for money,Its not working,Don\\'t buy,We vacuum-sealed ground beef, walnuts, raspberries, pork chops, crackers, and chips to test for suction capability, sealing strength, and ease of use.,Tried many times but still not working useless, I have purchased two of them, had to pay Rs. 650 per piece, I checked the price in local shop next door, the same brand, same watt, same piece was available at the shop for Rs 500, my return window got closed till then, BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM YOUR LOCAL SHOP.,I like product  value for money,It is really nice one. There are two things i need to tell you. It doesn\\'t fit to normal socket. You need to have bigger sized socket. The other one,  for pulling it back from power socket there is not sufficient grip. That is only the drawback. Thank you,Heating water,Value of money,Nice,Using this from last 2 year. No complaints yet. Nice Product.,Plug not suitable for normal swich board in india need adapter for that It seems to be good one for small family. But don\\'t know how long it\\'s battery will last? Can we buy it\\'s individual parts like battery, bottom plastic portion in case any damages happened? Or the blade if needed? So that it will become worthy buy n customer will also be happy n satisfied.,It\\'s a small and good for small item chopping at a time like 1 tomato or 1 onion,It works like a dream.,Easy to use.......,Easy to use,Very useful for traveling,nice product,Sometimes the button is not working Once you start using a bagless vacuum cleaner, you will never turn back (using it on a weekly basis since Nov 2021, so its a long tern review). Coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags, this one is truly a hassle-free cleaner, at least you are away from the hassle of maintaining/cleaning/replacing bags which is truly a mess, and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags. Further, devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then, leading to less suction.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••1. Vacuum cleaner unit2. Flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob3. Turbo brush nozzle4. Multi-clean nozzle5. High suction flat inlet nozzle6. Telescopic extension pipe7. User manual8. Warranty cardThe power cord is ~6mtr and device comes with a mechanish to retrace it back into the machine. It has normal 16 amp 2 pin top which can easily fit in 3 or 5-pin sockets (both 5/6 amp or 15/16amp), but better to connect it to 15/16 amp ones only considering its power consumption.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••➕ OBSERVATIONS & PROS•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. Device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with a bagless design where dust collects in a chamber, and you can empty it in the dustbin—no hassles of cleaning and replacing bags.2. Components are high quality, such as the telescopic extension is metallic, though it\\'s also a con for this attachment. Even plastic components are of good quality.3. Device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels. You don\\'t need to pull it by force.4. Default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted. Its a highly useful attachment considering it\\'s attached to a primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use.5. Each attachment here is multipurpose. When you open the package, you feel like very few attachments are provided, but when you start exploring, you discover that all attachments are multipurpose. (details below)6. Attachments are easy snap fit and remove (ActiveLock in the company\\'s terminology). Once you insert the attachments, it click locks and can be removed by a press of a button or release lever.7. Both the turbo brush and multi-nozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning8. Dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it. These filters can be washed once in a while to prevent clogging.9. the Main unit has H13 filter system to filter fine dust, dust mites, etc., and is equivalent to HEPA 13, as per the company. This filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes.10. Device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears. It\\'s in the bearable range.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••➖ OBSERVATIONS & CONS•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. Telescopic extension is metallic and heavy. So, it\\'s a bit of trouble to use for longer durations, especially when you are trying to clean ceilings.2. Reduction of suction power is via a bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction. So effectively, this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end, but then consumes the same amount of power. If there had been a control mechanism to reduce power, it would also save electricity.3. Device comes with a 16amp top but its 2-pin, so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes, it will be a trouble to plug it in everytime.4. I miss the blower system in this cleaner, which is handy at times (was there in my previous cleaner). They could have easily implemented it.For the cons reducing 1 star, but its definitely a 4-star device.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••🔧 Attachments•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••- Flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush, and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe- Multipurpose nozzle has a button to increase its suction power, and with one press, it goes nearer to the floor- Turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length, and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush, there is a button to lock it- Main unit has a system on the back and botton side to attach the multi-clean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes•••••••••••••••••••••••🏆 FINAL VERDICT•••••••••••••••••••••••This bagless vacuum cleaner is a hassle-free device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at a cost, and if you are willing to stretch your budget, it\\'s definitely worth it. I have had no any issues so far in the past 1 year, when using it regularly.,This is a nice bag less vaccum cleaner with a rotating brush that does a great job of cleaning. It also comes with good set of accessories. I found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the ‘Croma’ store. Two drawbacks (not a deal breaker) I found and I hope Philips addresses them were,1. It comes with a two pin 15 ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal 5 ampere plugs in the house. I was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during 15-20 minutes of cleaning each room in the house. I do not see a point in having that plug.2. During the use one just pulls it along but It has no handle to lift the machine. I believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but I am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the click-on mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as a whole all the time while moving the machine without the hose.As I mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if Philips addresses the issues on this great little machine.,Suction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet , window curtains ,floors and carpets.Cleaning the dust container is also very easy. Only concern i have is, if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine, the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor, after using the machine for nearly 1 hour and i pulled out the cord that was in the machine, it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this. would have been even better, if this had blower functionality also.,Good product,Cord length and Suction power is satisfactory,Good quality, heavy noise,This is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and I can say that I am a happy customer. I bought this back in August \\'22 and it is serving me well. It comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places, it has three modes of cleaning (tiled floors, carpets and sofas) and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier. Thank you Phillips for a good product and thank you Amazon for a smooth transaction.,Well-built, top-notch quality, suction power is too high. Lead should be strong,,I had a fantastic first day experience with this product, and because of the wire it works so quickly, I plan to use it more often.,It\\'s an excellent product at this price. Does what it promises to do. The best thing about it is that it\\'s made in india and runs on electricity and not batteries. I immediately tried it on two lowers that had lot of peeling on them. It cleaned them in no time and made them new again. I would recommend it for every household.,Use full to remove lint,A very useful and affordable purchase makes the cloth as new after using it , easy to use and does what it claims .Worth the purchase,The product works well and does the work it promises. Build quality looks good too and it is easy to use.👍,It is easy to use . We ordered this product after many research and reccomendation, The product is amazing and easy to use, There is a Separate Chutney jar and Smoothie jar for efficient usage,Silicon detachable base for better cleaning and also Stainless steel serrated blades for better grinding.The 600W powerful Motor helps in the grinding of Hard spices in no time. And the best part is it is super easy to clean.I am absolutely happy with this product and customer care support.,Product is good. Many jars available. Easy to clean. But food gets stuck inside the rubber. Noise is defintely there . However stopped working twice and got it exchanged twice as it is  under 1 year warranty . Service is good and very fast  But need to know how durable it will be after the warranty. .,The product is really good.. helpful I daily kitchen work... take s less space.... i faced some difficulty with the machine and jars.. but tye same was handled very patiently and quickly by the customer service section... pooja was handling my complaint and within few minutes she dispatched a replacement product for my request.... she was really very helpful.. recommending this product for each and every kitchen queen....,Cookwell bullet is a very good product and priced well for the performance it delivers.the grinding capacilty is superb and easy to make any chutneys, smoothies or paste in this with different jars,Good quality product for normal uses & easy to use.,Not much noisy .easy to clean and use.,Product is good . Easy to use,take a less space .. i faces some issues with the machine  called the customer service, they gave quick response and replace machine....I would like to say that their customer service very supportive and responsive..☺👍,Good customer care We are using it for cooking rice,,Its getting repair regularly,Recently I buy new rice cooker it is average,Excellent product,Very good product,Power adapter is not working pins are gone wrong. Remaking all are good,Like Must buy best Fabulous product I recommend this👍👍,For small place it’s gud,A great product. Works wonders on my vitrified tile floors. Item is good, but bottom lid should have provided along with the item.Once after blending juice or protein shakes we can use the top bottle directly as a sipper, but without bottom lid we cant close the juice bottle and the liquid will be spoiled if not drank within 30minsI request seller to provide bottom lid to close the bottle, even low cost blenders in market are providing.Else the product is ok,Good and compact... Good for travelers....,To prepare the juice, blends dry fruits with,for me it\\'s very helpful as I carry it while I travel,Extremely handy..very good for smoothies..price on the higher side though.,Good for travelling with babies or kids,It\\'s good, although it did give some start issue, it\\'s just that fruit/ veggies pieces should be small.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QWjkJPPzL._SY88.jpg,I bought with too much expectations and found out 500ml to be too low for blending a shake with one full apple, 50gm oats, milks and 15gm nuts. It struggles to start and we need to turn it upside down to give the blade some momentum and then it starts blending.For someone who is going to carry, it is your best bet. But for stationary heavy blending, buy something else with direct power source Pros:1. Most affordable option2. 2 year warrantyCons:1. No inlet and outlet pipes are given. You can purchase that offline or I found one pair on Amazon for 280/- inr2. It doesn’t come with any installation service or manual.An installation from Urban Company will cost around 500+taxes which is about 550/- INRHowever, after product delivery, Lifelong sent me a WhatsApp message asking about installation. They charge ₹353 for technician and ₹300 for pipes.So the cost is better by Lifelong support because within ₹600 you get technician and the pipes.Hence, choose to go with Lifelong service.,I am writing this review after using the product for 5 months. It is working amazingly. The company doesn\\'t provide installation support. You need to self install it. At the end it is value for money. Go for it.,THE COMPANY SHOULD PROVIDE TECHNICIAN FOR INSTALLATION AND CONNETING PIPE SHOULD ALSO BE PROVIDED BY COMPANY.OVERALL EASY TO SET UP .LOOK OF THE GEYSER ARE PREMIUM WITH WELL INSULATED COVER.,Product is good I was using this item from \\'3 years then again I brought more for new bathroom i very happy with this product fully satisfied with 3 years,Working well.. Worth buying..,Worth for the money,Good product value for money but accessories missing,Good product in price range, but power consumption is high, if this is ok, go ahead The instant heater was well made. And works well.,Nice product but how come one plug is not added. You need to pay 300/- for installation and 100/- for the plug. Connecting pipes another 399/- But otherwise good geyser for small family taking bath in different time,Good product. One star less because no connection pipe otherwise ok,Best,Okay,Like,Indicater just relocate but ok,Good product OK Product.,Very delicate but nice and accurate now see how long it will last,,Gives an error of +/- 30 milligrams,It stopped working after 7 months of use.,This is a sensitive product so it needs to be kept on a stable surface to use,it shouldn\\'t be overloaded like ever,cuz it will damage the sensor,Good product at this price. Built quality is not world class but good for temporary use.,Good I am pleased with my purchase. The installation process is easy, and the product is very reliable. The 4-level safety feature ensures that the water heater is safe to use and prevents accidental scalding. The water heater heats the water quickly, and the temperature can be adjusted to suit my needs. The only problem I am facing is with the indicator. Ideally, the red light shows that the water is getting heated, and it turns off when the water is heated enough. But in my unit, it\\'s vice versa. The green indicator is working as red, and the red indicator is green.,it is worth buying . it works well,First of all packaging was poor.Secondly Crompton says it is good for family of 3 members bath bucket but for that waiting is too long.Go for higher rated geyser from Crompton.,Installation is not hard. Instruction book is given. Only lacking point is warranty card is sign n seal. Warranty card is valueless,Works just fine, but I must say it is useful more for kitchen purpose, and in bathroom if u don\\'t use shower, cuz after running for a couple of seconds the temp. Of the water drops, heating is not that effective being instant. If anyone wants to take hot shower must go of geysers with larger storage capacity.,The packaging was good and intact. No connecting pipes were inside. The power cable was very short. That made things bit difficult. I bought a 3m lengthy connecting hose for cold and hot water supply. I installed it myself and registered online on Crompton site. If you have drill machine or if you can borrow it, it just takes two holes to complete the installation. Working well and makes hot water in 2mins.Do not connect using any extension box unless it is rated for 3000w. Otherwise the wires will melt. Better always try to connect directly with the socket.,Very useful product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618IzmLjN5L._SY88.jpg Nice,Working good so far, provides instant heating!,Everage productCompair to prize,Super product thank you for croma,Decent,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81n+UteNUzL._SY88.jpg,Good to handle and use...safe.. easily heat,Overall product is very good in this amount of money but get cold very fast This product little bit costly but quality was good,This does not remove all the lint cleanly. Only the easiest, lightest ones.,Sturdy.,Adhesion is good but price is high we will get in IKEA store for less,Extremely effective product and very decently priced.,👏👏👏👍👍👍,Worth to buy,Very useful product as I have 2 cats at home. Loving it Cannot extract small hair and takes lot of time,It clearly removes hair from velvet material but in clothes, not that much. I have a velvet bed for my dog and this serves it\\'s purpose. The cost is high and it is not available in the local market.,It\\'s not that great a product.,Overall the product is good in pocket friendly range.,Can be used only on velvet type material. Thread breaks when used on other materials,I bought it to remove my guinea pig\\'s hair from cloths but it doesn\\'t work well,This works perfectly to remove my dogs hair from sofa and chairs. It gathered even the smallest hair. Awesome product.,I have 3 short hair domestic cats and they like to sleep on my couch. This is a great way to remove furr without power vacuuming. They have not mentioned it here, or atleast I couldn\\'t see it, that an additional installation charge of ₹300/- is to be paid for installation by their technician. However you can choose to get it installed by a third party.,Good,good,Good service very quickly come nd given best service,,Good product,, nice remote...,Have been using atomberg for last 3 m and it is working fine without any issue.,Super happy 👌💯🤝 Useful,Takes long time to heat up water , not very quick with heating,पसंद हैकीमत कम काम ज्यादा अच्छा हैबहुत जल्दी हीटिंग चाय दूध या पानी गरम करना सभी काम आसानी से हो जाते इंडक्शन की बजाय इस प्रोडक्ट को बेहतर मान सकते है केतली जैसे 5 लीटर में या 7 लीटर में उपकरण उपलब्ध हो तो बता दीजिए ।तार की लंबाई कम से कम 1.5मीटर हो,Nothing to dislike,Cord length short,It\\'s 3years..... still using this for early morning hot water,After sells service is rediculaus product is very good within year its not working properly we tried a lot to reach to repair by service provider but we get any reply after a lot of follow up.Third class experience by Pigeon,Easy to handle Induction is good working,Lightweight and easy to use,V nice,Good quality product,Good Usha product induction 👍👍👍,Tea,,I have been using it for 2 weeks, so far there is no problem, but the current option probably comes in all.

It is as too good purchase.,👍,I used it its good.,This heater is very handy and can be operate easily.,It look great,,Excellent I bought it for ₹79. Don\\'t think that because this is cheap, it will be a poor quality product. These clips serve the purpose perfectly. I fail to understand what can be improved by paying more for other similar clips.,Second quality,In this photo you can see my old ones on left, after one year of use, still shiny.These are on right side, in comparison colour is very dull. Probably due to recycled material. Still very useful product. Worth the price paid.,The clips are okay. Colour is a bit dull compared to the picture given & material is okay. But its serving its purpose. Can buy it.,Convenient,Cheap plastic, but worth the price, does what it says.,Good quality,Doubting on its sturdiness. Average product. For this price range product design, look, spec and features provided is good. It would be great if havells pay attention in packing as the product box I received first had manufacturing defects and mising parts ( flexible pipes). After placing a replace request with Amazon, received other box which also had some minor scratches in the heater body and also found fastners were missing in the box.,Good Product at this price, heating is also very good, the major cons of this brand is installation problem. the installation workers never come for installation at your home, so you can arrange installation workers, otherwise every things is good,Havells should send trained technician for installation. The technician was asking for additional 600Rs charge for installing a tap of 280rs and labour charge, which I personally did it. Very disgusting guy. Havells to look inti the matter. Technician do not have proper tools with him and he asks from all tools from Customer including nails, pliers, hammer etc.,This geyser is worth to the money product as it only takes max of 10 -12 minutes to make iced water very hot as well as the indicator of the product is very good as it can be be clearly seen by low vision persion due to its size and colour deptness and also makes the look of geyser very good,Overall a good water heater.

NO RESPONSE FROM AMAZON.PLEASE SEND  REPLACE MACHINE ASAP.,So far good for chopping vegetables. I am vegetarian so no comments on mincing meat. Good for my family.,Initial impression in good, working as intended. Have used it to gring chicken and vegetables. So far working well. Gripping it while it\\'s on is a little dicey otherwise good product,Compact, Powerful mixer worth buying,Heating,Yes i like it very easy for chopping veggies,The container should have been made bit thick.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lHJua6NAL._SY88.jpg Look of the item is not impressive. Need to improve. Cord length is not sufficient. It should be bouble of the existing length.,Got this kettle yesterday but it got scratches on it and this kettle is bit noisy and automatic switch off is not working,Nice,Good work,Maza agya.,Liked most.easy to use.,I had gifted the item but now think i shouldn\\'t have. The item came with loose handle. When kept water for boiling the whole unit was hot including the handle and lid. It is not stopping automatically when water is boiled. Over all total waste of money. Didn\\'t expect from such a poor company.,Best price After receipt of Product received a Demo Request and opted for Demo Code Ref # 436360 .Today contacted Eureka Forbes for the Demo and understand there is No Demo for Vacuum Cleaners from their End.FYI Please & NA,Good...but complicated equipment,Blower function unable to use.,We didn\\'t receive stamped warrenty card with the product.,Compact and good,Value for money but there was no demo from Eureka Forbes. They did not bother to call us. The pipe provided are of very low quality. One of the pipe is already broken. They have sent a youtube link, thats the great support we got from the manufacturer,It is pleasure to clean without noise and stress.,This product from Eureka Forbes is very good. It lives up the name Eureka Forbes have made in Vaccum Cleaner market. Good Suction power. Easy power control. Cord length is also good with convenient button to roll it. Sufficient accessories which covers almost every area. Good Filters. Works on normal sockets which isn\\'t the case in some high power vaccum cleaner.Demo for the product provided by Ms. Priya was also good. Use of all the accessories was clearly explained and other necessary details to operate the product was clearly explained too.Overall I am satisfied with the product and service provided till date. Used it to keep the air inside as clean as possible. This model does provide clean air over a reasonable sized space if the windows and doors are kept closed.,Great product with a capability to reduce dust by approximately 3/4 e.g. if atmosphere pm2.5 is 300ppm , it will be reduced to upto 75ppm inside room , only if minimum ventilation is provided to take care the CO2 we generate.In my case , I have found in my area that the ambient has CO2 at ~410 ppm. If we open one window door to only by 5mm clearnce,  the CO2 is being maintained from 500 to 600 ppm  with 2 adults inside the room , based on wind velocity and direction. This adjustment 5mm clearance was achieved measuring with \"calibrated stand alone  CO2 cum PM 1.0, 2.5 , 10 measurement meter\"One more example with above ventilation arrangement, the machine is in auto and ambient air pm2.5 at 198ppm, room also at 198 ppm,  the  fan speed reached  medium (sound audible), it took some time to reach  85ppm  and then it took  1min from 85 ppm to  68 ppm,  now fan speed changed to low speed in Auto (sound is inaudible), this ppm  starts increasing gradually to 85ppm  in 1.5 minutes, now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm 2.5 is 198ppm.Similarly the fan speed (so it\\'s sound) can be very high if ambient pollution is very high.It needs external cleaning of it\\'s HEPA filter every month based on pollution. The sensor may need cleaning every 3 months for accurate readings (if sensor mal functions , it is to be cleaned first and check  before taking to any service center).It has a simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast 3 times the specified life, if we clean the HEPA filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularly.It does not have ozone producing UV rays or ion generators, which if not properly designed ( specified to customes not worry)  may pollute the air with ozone.It has particulate count PM 2.5 meter which is very accurate,  in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room (The readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter  CO2, PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10).We have to keep it on Auto to facilitate to change flow /speed based on pollution level (it\\'stemperature and humidity meters  are also useful).Update 24.04.22 (still under warranty) : It developed some abnormal sound just audible , when we go near to it (like kitch, kitch, kitch..) at lowest speed. Doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings, this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared, when it is made upside down.Bottom cover opened , side covers opened , the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in  slightly loose condition as anticipated. The abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut (with 13mm tubular spanner already available with me),  holding the fan  (nut is a  self locking type) and assembled back ,  But opening of side covers is a tricky and risky job (some locks may be broken, use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges , they may open in jerky motion ). I have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting (modification)  so that I can open the panels easily in future. However another Mi Air purifier 2S is working almost continuously without any problem from last 3 years.Update: 02.07.22 High abnormal sound observed. This time I want send it to service center , but while lifting some material flied off from grill. So, when I run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants , their wings and one baby lizard. Now again it is working normal.,Actualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter. in practicality we just plug and use it. Yes air quality is improving. But it does not reduce any Allergic issues.,Really liked the product, i like how it shows the current AQI, has a auto mode, night mode that is super helpful with a baby,The air purifier is 4/5 - is quiet, filters well and quickly. Will wait and watch for long term reliability, plus the replacement filters are expensiveBut the seller shipped an item in an open box, turned out to be a used product. Filter says 90% remaining, meaning it had been used to a good extent earlier. Not sure why \\'second hand\\' items are sold as \\'new\\'?,WORKS WELL SINCE 5 MONTHS. MORE COMMENTS WILL BE UPDATED SOONER.,I like because the performance is good and effective very easy to install,It works well but pollution level indicator is not reliable and keeps changing number very quickly in vide range so in night you can\\'t use night mode Everything was good. Just issue I found with the rubber. Which is used to tighten this. But i replaced that with my old one. Rest all good.,It\\'s slightly leaking from the side after installation.It\\'s bottom should firmly stick to the surface and seal properly.,What is the logic of tape sealing the top flap when the cartridge can be taken out and replaced back through the unsealed bottom flap of the product carton? In contrast the carton of the Pure It cartridge is sealed both at the top and the bottom.TATA Swach should correct this anomaly.,5 Star ⭐,Like,Need to change frequently,Good  quality,Good quality product I ordered 2 fans. One of the fans is making a sound. Whom do I contact,Speed is very slow,Good quality,decent fan,The rpm and air throw are good better than festiva and other models,First of all I have explored many ceiling fans. But when I saw high rating and positive reviews of this Havells fan, since then I had to buy this fan. Packaging was absolutely amazing with thick card board box, no chance of damaging. Air delivery was also very good, it cover whole room with zero noise, and looks premium as well.Thanks amazon,This product had come with one dent in the body. Rest all good. I liked the product,Good product and nice performance, also quality of parts is really good... Good one for usability,Its value for money. Convenient to place laundry dresses in basket.,According to the price, deal is very good if you increase a price little bit and zip then also i can buy this again,Defective product. Imperfectly stitched. It is a useful and good quality product, but the handles attached are assymetrtical and stitched in a way that makes it useless...the handles have been wrongly placed such that they pose problem while lifting or hanging the laundry bags.Apart from this issue of the handles, it is a good product.,Na,I liked it.,It\\'s nice little bit small ok good 😊, It is quite a nice product to use on your clothes. Makes them look fresh,I loved the product and highly recommend it!!,Its an amazing product to remove lint from woollens especially we it comes to kids clothes who frequently go to blanks with woollens,Product is good and Easy to use,It\\'s good product..good for parents having pets,It\\'s very easy to use to clean my coat, sofa nd sweatshirt also. These things have tried nd hope it will work on other clothes also very easily.,This is a good product for reasonable price compared to the expensive lint rollers available in the market. It does the work, handle is strong and sturdy, adhesion is good.,Its expnsive than others which u get in local market. It\\'s very easy to use we just need to handle it carefully it blends smoothly you just need to cut veggies or fruits into small pieces,My 1st use before I will putting to  charging in 4hrs.but it will work good now.let see how many days it will working!,Good,,Its easy to use,Build quality nice,Best product I use it and battery backup is too good you can use it 6 time of one time fully charged and smart features, Nice,This fan is working fine, I’ve been using it since 1 month. The thing which Bajaj can improve is the noise level of both motor and while cutting the air(design of blades) but considering the price it’s a perfect deal comes up with nice looking design and quality.,Low cost but does the job.,Nice,Good,Recently purchased for extra room. Actual performance will can be measured in summer only.,RPM is less. Bajaj quality is not maintained. Bearing sound in the initial start and low speed. The trust in Bajaj has come down after this purchase. The Bajaj fan purchased in 2004 is still working with out any complaint just I changed the capacitor for Rs25. The price is competitive,Value for money, better at this rate https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61JhAq4j0qL._SY88.jpg,I like this product,The product is good ..my only complaint is regarding the cells..along with the machine, the cell were sent separately which were of no use..i had to purchase them separately,When I bought it worked really well. Light weight and portable makes it convenient to use. Initially it was a great product. Not sure what happened after few months, it was difficult to tare. When I switch on and display shows zero. Immediately after, it start moving to minus and takes long time to tare back to zero. Which makes it annoying and inconvenient. Also not sure about it’s accuracy seeing this instability to tare.,Good product for kitchen item.accurate and easy to carry. Loved it,Great same day delivery of item received just now..Also very user friendly no issues in usage with batteries included all inside that,Good enough,Good quality thanks Good and easy to use,Very good,Good.,Overall a good product to buy. Just not understanding what temperature is best. Sometimes it burns the bread at 2, sometimes 2 gives the best roast and sometimes it doesn\\'t roast the whole bread. So, a little confused with that.,It\\'s a simple device, functions as it should. Setting the temperature and cleaning are easy.,Do not forget to preheat every time the toaster is put to use. Thereafter, adjust the control as needed - for soft toast (1-3) or for crisp roasted toast.,The quality of Baking toast is Amazing,Nyc Lights inbuilt in this create psychological effect as they changed according to the quality of air but apart of that no visible change i have witnessed yet.,Bought it after reading a lot of reviews. It is boxy in shape but a no nonsense and powerful air purifier. Easy to assemble, easy to clean and good air flow. The silent mode will be more than sufficient if it is PM that you\\'re trying to get rid of. The purifier is so effective that it draws out moisture also so do not be surprised if you feel a dry throat in the morning. I run it for a few hours in silent mode and then switch it off to avoid the dehumidifier effect. Worth the price and great customer service.,I am extremely happy with this purchase.The purifier is very sensitive to impure air, and makes sure to trigger purification of highest level to bring the AQI down under Good quality.The HEPA filter has longer life than most other products. Also, the AQI indicator is through at LED indicator that is more accurate than the digital interface which comes with other products.The installation and functioning is extremely simple and can be done in 5 minutes.The best part is the support you receive from Coway. The day the delivery from Amazon was supposed to happen, I got a call from support executive intending to help with installation and related things. A follow up call was also made to describe more.The product comes with 5 yr warranty and additional two years was provided upon registration.My flatmate also purchased the same after seeing mine functioning.,Good,Only drawback I found is that it does not show any reading for the pollution level. After turning it on in auto mode it turns from red to orange and then to green within 10-15 mins, but showing the pollution level along would have been more convincing.,I wanted a no non-sense machine for the children\\'s bedroom, to control and allergies and dust especially during the winter / smog season here in Lucknow. My kids are happy with the machine since it is very easy to use and I am happy since it seems quite easy to maintain as compared to the other brands / models. Rajnish gave a nice quick demo of how to use it and maintain the device, and also how to register for the 7 yr warranty. For now, I am quite satisfied with the service and the product.,I got this product as second purifier in home. Amazed to see the performance with simplistic looks and no jaziness. Works well. I think two things can be enhanced - 1. Provide a handle to move the product around and 2. Color option.Rest all no complaints.For testing I opened the windows and then ran this purifier and in the same room I kept my Dyson to monitor AQI level. Within 30 mins it brought down the AQI level in room which was monitored by Dyson.Happy with the quality and highly recommended., Nice 👍,The one thing I liked is its work very well and is really easy to install... But i did expected it to be little more big but the size is small,spares difficult to buy,Cheap and good pure it,The filteration speed is slow. Don\\'t go for it if you are a family.,Installation is a bit tricky but can be done .this varient is fit for a family of 2-3 people only.it takes time to pour water in the filter.... overall fine product,This filter is very small for 1 person, What I would like to advise all of you out there is, please do not judge a product on the basis of the reviews on here.It can be carried anywhere easily.Can be used on a standard 6A socket, no need of power plug.The heating element is also of good quality.Go For It without\\xa0any\\xa0Doubt,never expected amazon sending a product.it was without manufacturer\\'s pakcaging.had a big bent on metal . did not return because needed.No paperwork.,Item received in a good condition.Works very good.Highly recommended.Much much better than conventional room heater,Zaruri nhi reputed company ka hi product acha ho, yeh product bhi acha or iske price bhi kam h.I like it,I bought this for my dadi as our room is on top floor & its very cold here. It is working fine till now & it\\'s power consumption is also less than 1000w heater, i onserved less unit usage from this 750w heater,Very bad product. The coil is of bad quality....broke within two days of use,Excellent hot with 5 amp socket. Thanks Amazon,Best product in this price range 👍Very lightweight and convenient to use Good to go overall good product,Good,I like this product very much as compared to other brand,Powerful motor,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71EtEyoiI8L._SY88.jpg,It is good product...recommended for buying...specifically juicer is good....noise level is normal (with comparison to other branded products at this price) ...,The juicer part seems badly designed as the fruit get stuck and only after half a glass of juice you have it jammed and have to clean it.Don\\'t get this if you want a juicer.Rest is pretty good, the 750 Watt motor is very powerful and could grind sugar easily. The juicer feels like a gimmick to sell this at a higher value.,Very good Good product considering the price. Loved it.,Nice product,Good,The product is okay. But this is my replaced product. It still is dirty inside on the bottom part. Feels like an old product. The first product was also dirty and then I replaced and they keep sending me products with dirt on it!,It is very good product. But if it\\'s big size most useful for laundry purpose,It\\'s looking good.Value for money.I wish base is tuff one rather than light clothed,The product is goodOnly thing I didn’t like is it does not stand and which irritates sometimes,Very easy to use and can be folded and can be stored anywhere.. Must have product Like it,Awesome product 😊,Follow the instructions to get the hassle free boiled egg, automatically switches off when the water is boiled out.

Works well, except that the coating is fragile and some of it came out when I used a metal utensil on it while it was still hot. Except for that issues, the product is 5/5.,Product could be more sturdy.,Good product, but the quality is not so good, easily  breakable,,Good Purchased 10 liter and 3kw model for faster heating. It takes about10 minutes to heat water from room temperature to its highest temperature setting. Faced one problem in this heater on very Frist day of installation. The green light indicator which indicates heating in progress stopped working on first day. Called the vguard technician and he said there is problem with voltage selector knob. Vguard should look in to quality control as other users have also reported this green light indicator problem. giving one star less for this problem. This water is working good otherwise.,The heating system worked perfectly. However, the digital display was faulty. There was a replacement option available when we bought it. But when we opted for replacement the product was our of stock. Hence, we had to return it.,Using it from last 1 monthTill now no problem & working very fine,Easy to use, quick heating overall nice product to consider in given price range,same day Installation provide by V guard thru v-guard whatsapp contact because before the delivery i booked for installation... installtion price 350+ 250 for Steel inlet outlet pipe because this model didn\\'t provide inlet outlet... overall my experiece is amazing with this gyser it take 30-45 min for full heat my dial is set for 45 degree+but u can use the hot water after 10 min. of heating... look wise cool and simple... i recomended to all of you go for this product 100%,Good,Good performance-- Geyser,Nice ,Simple stitching for self purpose.,Ye small h isliye portable to h but designer clothes me mushkil hoti h.

Iron stopped working after 2 months. Not worth it,thankyou,Water comes out,  when ironing,Operating is complicated, not easy.,Damaged item i received so i return my product but not responding not good this project heavy heat,Product is just ok. Firstly I got the cracked jar but the product replaced the very next day. I like the new and compact design of the product, easy to clean and assemble, and the powerful motor with no speed option. Chopper choped and blender blend wonderfully.Things I dislikes the most is the noise, its fully plastic material(the only thing which is not a plastic to open eye is the blades only) and the juice extractor which isn\\'t a juice extractor actually.,I always wanted a juicer, and then I found this. It works like a magic so easy and so quick. The blender is also good. I using it almost every day for my juice and milkshakes. The major problem with this is that it doesn\\'t have a regulator 😕 and also no on and off switch that\\'s the major drawback. Over all I liked it. No other issues good product.,The product is so good.But I got cracke in chopper jar after using just two or three time.So let me know can I exchange it only chopper jar?,The product build quality good. Using the product is very easy and after use cleaning is very easy too....

It\\'s juice making skill was so so nice...It\\'s very easy to clean..,I bought this mixer grinder and juice blender combo. It is very handy and effecient in usage. Grinds all dry and wet material nicely. The juicer gives fresh juice and removes all seeds without giving bitter taste. Crushes ice also well. Blender makes all kind of shakes and smoothies. Great for everyday use.,We can use easily good product for all,I use it inmy daily routine, This is my first coffee frother and I just loved it.

It is Worth buying.,Worst product,This product is easy to control and easy to clean, you can use it as coffee, foam maker, hot chocolate maker. Best in market.,I ordered this for my own use. It\\'s a really very amazing coffee frother as well as mixer for milk.Very reliable product. Good mixer under 3500,Noise level is slightly high, but quite efficient,Product is ultimate 👌 super.,Mixer quality was very nice bt juicers jar not up to the mark,Very noisy. But works fine. Would have loved if it had extra bowl for that extra blade. Hectic to change blade into another bowl for using the extra blade. [Suggestion: One inverted jar would be nice too.] The juicer has the loose locking system, all others have good locking systems. Some plastic from mesh was cut when using it, that needs better alignment. Overall worth the purchase. Even with the excess noise. Also the screw tightener for changing blades broke after 3-5 changes of blades. But that is not big deal. It would have been better to have durable nut tightener.,Recommend to buy this good quality attachments and powerful 750 watt motor. Not less than bosh grinder at less price.,I had  purchased Active 1 kw earlier from Amazon but the item being imbalanced was returned for replacement. The replacement piece received has the same defect which was returned for good. Then in view of the reviews I went for this item and so far its performance is satisfactory although some of the reviews were discouraging. If you want power as well as reasonable rates, go for it.,Very  good item Product is very handy but the water capacity is too low!Disappointed with the product\\'s pricing considering its wattage and usage time. You can\\'t iron more than 2 clothes before water refill.Since the mouth area is not that much, you\\'ll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole cloth.Steam amount is fine but design is such that you can\\'t press it hardly on to the cloth during ironing.So overall do keep in mind before buying that it\\'s only for emergency & travel purpose for de-wrinkling already ironed clothes.,Good product. Does what it says. Though the water tank could have been bigger.,better to buy normal iron box,Takes a lot of time and is not very easy to use. You will need to use the conventional iron even after using this steamer for most of the clothes. Works only for the synthetic fabrics. It\\'s better to stick to the conventional iron.,Hiii the water tank is too small and can only use for one shirt or T shirt,so plz concentrate on this also,Absolutely good. Easy to handle and flexible movement. It took me less than 5 mins to iron Kurti.Advice to users - please follow the instructions carefully, have some patience and it works great.Negative - Water chamber is very small and it takes 1 full tank to iron 1 shirt/1 kurti.,The Product is good, unfortunately it came withou a manual. I had to figure our where the water tank was and use it . Otherwise the product works well.,Very low water storage is what put me off. Otherwise its just ok. Does the job. But at times need to refill water even for single garment Very usefull , lekin size mai zara choti h, otherwise fine,Durable and quality products. Essential for multi purpose use.,Product quality is good,Good quality product in such price. Fine spray. Cute little funnel and stickers were also there.Thumbs up 👍🏼,These spray bottles are made of high quality plastic and the spray is also very effective.I found this product very helpful and easy to use, highly recommended!!Regards,Manish.,It is very useful... 👍,Plastic quality is very good,Nice bottles.....good plastic material not a eassy to bare this product , in this product realsing heavvy  noise pollution in 4 th spped,Not Bad in this price,The fan works well at high speed.

Ans me ..,Does the job efficiently that\\'s all., Like,Return value of spent money,Doesn\\'t look like waterproof material.N small in size,The bag has two stitched fabric straps on either side that act as handles. These straps are not stitched properly and will break easily.,It’s diameter is not so large as seen in photo, and also it doesn’t have wire supports to stand on its own. If you’re purchasing such product look for one which have spherical wire support,Good quality... value for money..,The quality of material and stitching is good, but it is not sturdy.,Good but a little costly for what it is. Ok,Badhiya h..,The attachments could have been a bit longer,This beater is less than half the price of regular branded ones but seems to do the job well.Not sure about heavy duty use but extremely handy for whisking eggs, ice cream, meringue, or light cake batters.This is the exact same beater that seems to be available under many names on this site with prices ranging between 430 to 599 (as of Dec 2022) so if buying pick the cheapest available price like I did.It doesn\\'t come with any warranty, but I took a chance and seems to have paid off.,Ko,Have been using it for months and still it works smoothly. It\\'s very easy to use and clean and is effective. Go for it,It’s one of the most Convenient product and multiple use. It’s durable and easy to use. I really like this product. 10/10.Must buy it.,Great product! Value for money. Go for it! Overall, I love this Oratech Coffee frother and have used it soooo many times since purchasing it. I mostly use it to make whipped coffee but I\\'ve also used it for mixing protein powder in milk and frothing milk / creamer for coffee.It is incredible effective for exclusively liquid substances like milk and creamer; I realized this after over-frothing my creamer one morning to the point of pure foam lol. After that I kept it in mind and I know to only do it for a short amount of time. Super easy to use, versatile in what it can be used for (as far as liquids go), and tbh it just looks really cute on the coffee-making section of my counter. The stand is a hugeeee plus, I definitely wouldn\\'t purchase an alternative option without one.It gets the job done for whipped coffee.I also use this product to blend my matcha powder and my turmeric-cinnamon-ginger-coconut milk powder lattes. This frother takes out all the lumps and bumps. Because the resulting blend is smooth, it does not waste the ingredients like stirring with a spoon. So, so great! It has made my favorites even more practical and delicious. I have not found anything about this product that I do not like. I would recommend this product to others and have already done so. Get it! You will be pleased. It is the best Coffee Beater.,I really liked this coffee frother. With its help I am making Cappuccino Latte at home easily.

Which is available on Amazon. Packaging was not good no bubble wrap and only few pieces of thermoco, due to that some dents were there. Since we liked the product and don\\'t want to wait again we kept it.,Agaro has provided a very Good Product at decent price range. Amazon has delivered the product in a very nice and safe package. Entire package did not had even a single mark. OTG is very easy to use and very useful for food lovers. I have however felt necessity of improvements on two things (1) It is very difficult to set exact time and temp in manual nob and (2) Power plug size is small and difficult to tight fit into 15 amp plug.,Don\\'t go on its small size...it makes wonderful cakes and bread.,Though overall quality is Good.,Oven is great for making cakes and grilling too,Excellent product.. Value for money,A good product. Got more than what i expect Does the work,Good,Superb,All good.,Philips a trust worthy product. Very easy to use and light weight iron,Great product. Has many features. But using them is tricky. I tried to use the Steam and Spray for a few weeks and gave up. I wish the Product Owner had focused a little more on Easy of Use. There is no point in having great functionality, if end-user can\\'t easily use it.,Overall it\\'s good but after a month inside wire was disconnected it\\'s stopped working it took me another 2 days to get it fixed by near by electrician.,Using it for a month. So far it is working well. Heats up quickly, like the quality of product and steam functions. The product is delivered in 1st week of Feb, 2021 which is almost the end of winter.It is used by my parents.Ease of use: better as compared to many othersIt has got three level of heating that can be selected by simply rotating the knob of a switch.(Some other brands have two separate on/off switch for two heating elements to obtain different levels of heating. That operation is a little difficult to explain to an elderly person over phone)Improvement required: Temperature setting mechanism- digital display is badly missed!Currently, there is no mechanism to know the temperature which is being set by rotating the temperature setting knob. You simply have to guess initially and then wait and do trial and error as the temperature starts increasing slowly. It\\'s a slow process and you can\\'t get the right temperature in one go!Digital display of temperature setting may be added.This is a general problem- I didn\\'t find digital display in any brand. This can easily become a differentiating feature.This will be particularly very useful for elderly people.In today\\'s time when electronics is everywhere, missing out on implementing digital control of temperature appears to be sheer lack of initiative.Quick suggestion:slightly bigger size is better with oil based heaters.,Works good for me in Himachal. Consumes electricity but u getSilenceNo dry eyesComfortable environmentBuy it if u value ur comfort n silence.otherwise take any other blower which will dry ur eyes n throat and create a sound,I liked the fan mode and the amount of heat it generates,Wrong advertisement. Only 11 fins for a 13 fin oil heater.,Good product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rppgjBjFL._SY88.jpg,Superb,Good value for money Good product. Weight is reduced a bit,Damage product deliveredTwo times,works fine even after 4 months as of now going good,Fine  good to use,లైట్ వెయిట్,perfect for use,Good,👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 This product is good, its only customer support and service that is pathetic. If not for that this product would have had real good rating. I received a slightly defective piece where indicators where not working. I initially raised an issue about it but there was no immediate support for that. As filter was working fine and we didn\\'t require indicators, we didn\\'t bother to follow up. After several days the service guy came and fixed it. First time when the service guy came there was no one. So he came again and got it fixed. For immediate support, its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service , as going through the official support delays the process. So considering all these I feel product is decent.,Free services are limited. If we change the filter during the free services, we will be charged. Filter is not free of charge during the free services.,Product is good but the service is worst till i experienced  .if your staying in rural areas and your  planing to buy this than i will say don\\'t prefer  because I have called minimum 20 times to the Custer care they always saying that they will send the service person but even no one is calling you to response .If your product is in service period the service person even don\\'t lift your call and say the answer .Once the lady has called me and asked some details after she say it is not come under there area and she will forward it after i think five days has been completed and i called her back she replied rudely and saying i told you this is not come under there area and i asked her atleast give me my area service person number .She gave me atlast and i called the service person and he replied he didn\\'t recieve any complaint id so raise a complaint on service request then he will come .I am frustrated and take my product and went to Guntur to repair it . Previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged. They told me you have to replace the pump it cost around 3000 . I have changed it and decided not to call the service person and write a review on Amazon so the people will know about the service centre.,Installation guy didn’t install propery, due to which water was not being purified for last one month.

Have used it for 4 years and still continuing .,Now I want my kettle to be repaired or exchange if needed reason after three months it stop heating… or you can say stop working . Thank you,After a month of use, the bottom plastic emits a charring smell, affecting the water\\'s taste. Thru their app, I logged a complaint. The gentleman who is in contact with me is asking for an invoice I could not provide on time due to the mobile Amazon app did not support to download. I received a call from customer service about canceling the service ticket. Later I contacted the service engineer he said nothing worked. He ordered the part someone will visit to replace. No action. I raised another ticket still in open status with no effort. I may approach the national consumer helpline for action.,Easy to clean but not everyone can use. Kind of heavy.,The price is reasonable...water capacity is sufficient and boiling is fast used first time Inalsa electric kettle will update review after one month of usage.. best product,High quality product which is so convenient to use. The design is so nice and presentable that it can be used to serve directly to guests at home or office. Value for money,The quality of the tapes are as expected and they are really good. Value for money. This is the best rate I could find here for a lint roller.,Found this lint roller to be quite good. The adhesion is great. Needed this mainly to clean hair off of jackets and such and works really well. Gets all the hair and lint off without damaging the material of the jacket. The handle is sturdy although the rotating bit rattles a little but nothing that adversely impacts use. All in all would definitely recommend!,Its easy to use and value for money product... Can be stored and used easily...,It\\'s very easy to use and good quality of the product 👌,I saw it first time on youtube , so thought of giving a try and it is totally worth it. Was suprised u get 4 of them with 90 sheet each . I use it not only for lint but to also remove tony dust particles from my desktop and mousepad. Must tey if u haven\\'t used lint roller before.,Amazing product good quality Go for it….,If you have dog or cat in your home this product is must!! It is really usefull,  It works on almost all type of clothes and it can be used on bedsheets curtain or on sofa.. I ordered set of 4 and it has 90 layers on each so its budget friendly as well, go for itt!!!! Here is a try at a review of this product after using it for an year now.Use Case :-I am a NCR resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst. I have it installed in the bedroom, about 300 sq ft so well within the advertised max room space. While using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution addition.Build Quality :-The purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing. It has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet, and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet. The arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front. This helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required. The top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular LED screen. The 4 buttons are - Power, Night Mode, Fan Speed, and Child Lock.Setup :-The air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately. Thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use. The setup is pretty straightforward. The main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space. The installation order of the filter is as followsFirst -> HEPA Filter. (The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left Corner)Second -> Active Carbon Filter. (The same has indication on top to correct installation. You can also go with keeping the Phillips Branding on the top left Corner)Third -> Pre Filter. This one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust / impurities so that it does not clog the other main filters.Thus the filtering order is Pre Filter -> Carbon Filter -> HEPA filterWorking :-The air purifier can be set to different modes. One of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor. The pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly. 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular LED screen by means of circular rings of different colors - Blue (Min), Violet, Pink, Red (Max). Red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automatically.If you are not a fan of the automatic mode, you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speed/modes. They areFan Speed 1 - Indicated by 1 on the screenFan Speed 2 - Indicated by 2 on the screenFan Speed 3 - Indicated by 3 on the ScreenAutomatic Mode - Indicated by A on the ScreenAllergen Mode - This can be only added on top of Automatic Mode. It essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels. This is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rate.Turbo Mode - Indicated by T on the Screen. This puts the fan in the maximum speed possibleThats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier. Additionally the filter has an automatic/forced night mode. The purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode. The same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier. What this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode, the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noise.Summary :-So as to summarize my review and add my view here, the filter works pretty well for the use case i have. On regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control, even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from Red levels to Blue. Switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels. On drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control. If not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levels.The air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product. Much that is missing in similar priced competitors.I am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise. I believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible. By reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days, but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse (when i dont want to use turbo mode just yet)Durability of the filters has been decent. I have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the HEPA or the Carbon Filter. On yes that reminds me the Air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen. It even does that for the pre-filter which does not have to be replaced but just cleaned/washed. That i have received 3-4 times this past year.Overall i still strongly recommend this product- Good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launched.,Good product,The product does not stand out notably, but it probably does the work it is supposed to. It is too late now to return this product and try another make.,Over all good product.bEasy to install,Well designed product. Yet, to experience filter replacement and, consequently, the recurring cost.,The product is working nicely and worth buying product.,Writing after almost 1.5 years all pros n cons Everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 6-8 months it become totally black few advice1. Dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked.2. If you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners.3. Seal your doors most dirt & mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them.4. Run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was.5. You can clean pre filter only don\\'t clean carbon and hepa filter.6. Being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 4-5 times keep it under sun light for 4-5 hours.7. Sometimes u get error of FO clean all three filter with vaccume or brush (careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask) after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8. Bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly 300rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them.9. Update fan speed got slow down10. Power consumption- on 1st- 23 watt, 2nd- 33 watt, 3rd 40 watt, max 50 watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to 23watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode11. Do not left your room door or window open it will continue to be red room should be closed,Room is still dusty not much functional It is very beautiful looking and appears imported good for placing at one spot on office table etc. and not to be moved. It is very light so easily tumbles down. wire cord is very short. Heating is good. It is not strong and sturdy but made of plastic outerbody which will break if it falls down.,More than a week,im using this product.Pros:compact,easy to use,portable,good built quality.Cons:Light weight,No manual control over saftey switch,takes time to heat a small room,small cable length.Conclusion:If you are looking for a gud luking compact heater you can buy it.If you are expecting high skip it.,I like the product design & quality..I\\'m using in my room.. It takes 15 to20 min to reduce the room temperature... I will recommend this product..,The only positive about this device is its price. Otherwise, all it has is negative.The heater is very light weight, but that\\'s a negative coz it\\'s too light to trust it to work safely. A device working at such high temperature require some weight to have stability so that weay feel confident that it won\\'t topple. The manufacture has given a safe switch at the bottom of the device, but the device remains at high temp for sometime even after being off.The material body material feels very cheap and doesn\\'t give confidence that it would last long though the PTC heating element may last long.There is nothing to prevent entry of dust and fiber into the heater, that may lead to a fire in the long run if fibres accumuulate inside.Also, without any dust filter the heating plates will get blocked very very soon.The switch on the backside to switch off and on also appears to be of the cheapest quality.There is not temperature control in this heater....so once you start it it will run continuously so can\\'t be used as overnight heater in your bedroom.So I would suggest, it would be better to go for slightly costly heaters which have temp control and better quality.,As abious amazon delivery service is awesome received this product in 2 days.Build - Built qiality is amazing dint expect this, Metal frame and smooth plastic finish, light weight to carry and portable.The best part I liked about it, it never took time to heat, just switch it on and it started blowing heat and it easily heats the room withing minutes. But bare oin mind it takes 220V power.All I can say is, its the best product in this price. You will not regret buying it.,The Heater is effective, easy to use , and very compact. Work is good, I like it very much.,Av very low quality heater without any temperature control. It burned my switchboard. It keeps drawing current without any control.,Great product for the price, considering it has ceramic element. Value for money, performance well,Review after 1 month. Good product. 4 stars.,Easy to use, comfort to handle nice product,I got this dry iron today and it looks really good and I think it should be the ideal one for dry pressing and weight is quite heavy of 1.8 kg and it\\'s big one but weght might be a problem for week women. But unfortunately I have to return it as lot of  scraches are there on non sticky plate and that will follow a further damaged over there in future. UT here I want to inform you that many people have already got these scratches and they have returned it. So be very careful to verify before using it,I like it overall the best.,Heavy weight but I like it super build quality,Valuable money,Best iron box It is a good product with easy to use functionality and easy to clean .Can accomodate and boil 7 eggs at a time, when water gets evaporated totally, it automatically cuts off the power supply and turns off the light .The bottom of water container can be used to make a hole in the eggs and hence eggs can be peeled off easily after boiled properly.We can also set the water level and how much to boil the eggs . According to the level of water we put in, the eggs are boiled . If we put in less water, eggs are boiled less and vice versa.Overall a nice and handy product, easy to use and easily portable. Comes with strong and good build quality.Must buy for gym lovers and frequent boiled egg eaters.Go for it !,I need boiled eggs daily and thats why I was looking something good and friendly to use and I purchased this egg boiler. This Wipro egg boiler made my life super easy.It comes with an auto cut system and this way I can get any 3 types of eggs whatever I want. Cord is short but manageable.,Nothing,It is easy to use .But it is only useful for only boil egg.It’s power cord is very short so it’s very difficult to connect.,Review,Ok,Better by a 300 wala,Overall it\\'s good. We can get hard, medium or soft boiled eggs. Cleaning is an issue. Sometimes it gets very dirty and it looks like it is corroded. First of all i wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly.. so i reviewed many juice blender and finally i bought this Philips HR1832.. i made carrot..apple... Orange.. promoganate..etc... All i did and had fantastic juice... Fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash.. thanks for this instant juice blender.,Good deal,I find this Juicer amazing; end-to-end it takes me around 10-15mins to extract the juice, clean & pack it back. That easy it is to Use!,The product is very good and user friendly. Exactly as demonstrated in video,I used to have juicer many moons ago but it was a cheap model and never really produced the juice I wanted and I couldn\\'t afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so I was excited to be able to start using this new one. First off this is a nice compact design. It really doesn\\'t take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surface.The juicer is simple to take apart and put together, instructions are not really needed, though there are some basic pictures provided on the box.The juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small. I need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not a huge flaw it is a shame as you wouldn\\'t need it to be much bigger to get them in. So far my juicing attempts have all been successful - apples, raspberries, grapes, cucumbers, carrots have all yielded a fair amount of great tasting juice. I also unwittingly popped a chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesn\\'t work with - it seemed to work fine for me. I can see how a banana or avocado might not work, but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment. The pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and I found I could easily squeeze liquid out but it\\'s in no way dripping and I would say a decent job had been done. I know that there is a lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldn\\'t want in the pulp. That way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with it.Juicers produce different quality juices. There are really 2 key areas to judge a juicer on it\\'s juice quality.#1 Some juicers produce a higher amount of juice per food item. You can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted.#2 Some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice - 2 signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients. A faster spinning juicer (centrifugal) will often produce more heat and froth, which is why the masticating style juicer (slower, chewing action) creates better quality juice.In terms of these 2 key areas, this Philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice. The slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers.  To get more descriptive,  I like to run the pulp of the Philips through the juicer 1 time to get extra juice out of it. Running it a 2nd time and I get hardly any juice. One extra run of the pulp is sufficient.The specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under 1 minute. I think this is a little optimistic but that said its not too far off. All the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes a little more effort is the metal sieve and grater. This has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff. That said I have found that using a soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly. It certainly does not take much elbow grease and I found it very easy to clean off - unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used it.I think this is a pretty decent juicer for the everyday user. Yes it could produce a little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits. The anti drip spout is not quite anti-drip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as I have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place. For the current price I would say it is well worth it.,High quality premium juicer, with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max (80 to 90%) juice out of fruits and veggies. The look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are available,I have been using this for a month now.It is easy to use, and clean and assemble.But at times, I have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes a different sound while it is grinding.I feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut a bit smaller and not like a slice, cause if i cut like a slice/flat, one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made a different sound and it was not giving more juice but i could see the pulp.Try to cut the carrot pieces of atleast 1-2 inch size like a round one and not like a slicebut overall, good experience as i make carrot and beatroot juice and  it takes 15-20 minutes to cut, grind and clean.very easy to use and very easy to assemble.Thanks,Perfect home juicer , easy to clean, assemble and comparable i loves it This weighing scale is made of good quality material. Looks sturdy, weighs accurate but the scale I got has detective display. First 2 digits looks clear and then next digits are not clearly visible. I am returning this item and amazon accepted my return request.,Received on time... Product is very good in condition..,Better productI like,Very helpful product,Really best product use shop nd home ..Received it today and checked it\\'s capacity.. it is coming around 10 kg. Overall looking is good.hope that performance will also be good,Received the weighing scale in good condition. Looks exactly the same as the product display. Working good at present. Happy with the purchase. Thanks to the seller and to Amazon Value for money,Not as effective as claimed, just an average product, built quality medicore.,Good, very good product, very easily to use good working. But charger cable is very vary short. I lick this.,the product is that good as the rating show it to be and the reason for it is , that the seller is bribing people for 50 ruppee paytm cash and rating them 5 start , this is cheating .the quality of the product was not up to the mark and it didn\\'t work after 2 days,Worst,Rechargeable....3 speed modes and it gives perfect and creamy froth..value for money 100 percent Product is good, easy to use. But there is a misleading information on Amazon about warranty, In amazon they mentioned 2 Years of Warranty + 6 months of extended warranty. But when i contacted Customer care they told 1 Year of standard warranty + 1 year extended warranty(motor only) on Registering in thier website and only 6 months warranty on Jar blades,Very simple to use,,Easy to use, easy to clean.,The product is good..,Over all Very nice Blender. Easy and convenient to use. I can prepare varieties of juice and it can blend nuts as needed , It Works as expected , Recommended,Easy and quick to use especially in the mornings when there is time pressure,Within 6 months the motor stopped working,then after raised a compliant, they picked the product and checked then informed - technician confirmed that your blade is not in condition to function properly.the blade has 6 months warranty and according to the invoice its out of warranty so you have to purchase new blade from us.---- and they shared one video for checking the product, it\\'s like one road side shop. So Balzano having road side shop as service center 😬 The vacuum claims to have a \"powerful motor,\" but it struggles to pick up even basic dirt and debris. I have tried using it on both carpet and hard surfaces with little success.Additionally, the dust collection feature is practically non-existent. Despite multiple uses, the dustbin remains almost completely full after each use. The lighting feature is also fairly useless, as it is not bright enough to be of much use in illuminating the areas being cleaned.Overall, I would not recommend the Swiss Military VC03 Wireless Car Vacuum Cleaner. It is a poor performer and does not live up to its claims. There are much better options available on the market for car vacuum cleaners.,👍 good,Good one. Go for it,Cleaning, suction power as claimed.,Suction power is not very impressiveDoes the jobStruggle for duct that sticks to the floor .Visible and easily removed duct is sucked,Works better than the previous ones I bought.,Product seems good but 6 months warranty Card not received inside box. Box was damaged from one side.,Easy to use and friendly The first time I tried it send the eggs and the milk cream all over the kitchen. Big mess so i suggest that you try it with water in a cup or bowl to get the feel of it. Then you will fall in love with this gadget. Easy to clean just rinse under the tap. The charge holds up just about for a job so you don\\'t burn or heat up the motor. Frothing for a cup of coffee or creaming eggs for a fluffy Omelette is easy peasy. Flimsy for ruff use but hey you can\\'t complain for the price your paying.,This is nice for people who wishes for a durable device to blend and whisk their eggs , coffee, milk , etc for a luxurious vibe. Nice as it doesn\\'t operate on battery but electric charge. I feel the price might look steep, but otherwise the product is a 10/10,Good product and easy to use and it very reasonable price I loved this product but it think that they have to increase the capacity of battery power except this all is good,It\\'s a good handy product. Works well and is easy to use. It will definitely make your work in kitchen simpler.,The product was easy to use and reachable in few minutes,Useful product very good 😊,Easy to use excellent,Value for moneyNd easy to use Nice product & good quality,Value for money, as per description.,Very easy useful,Good product,Product is good,Good,Good,Best to buy under 500.

Water flow is slow but good for a 1L tank .They give 1 year extra warranty if we write 5 star review, So giving only 4 stars .Maybe most of the 5 star reviews are only for extended warranty .Amazon should act on this kind of seller .,IT is excellent designed by Havells. Free installation was done by Havells on very next day of purchase. Used for kitchen, performance is outstanding. Value of money.,The product was delivered within a day and technician came the same day to install it. The product is very easy to use. Loving it! Works really well, perfectly boiled eggs without cracking eggs which happens in gas stove cooking and very easy to clean.,Build material is decent. Issue I found a little was with cleaning the heat pan. But it\\'s so much better than the half price cheap ones we buy,Good product,Very easy and hassle free use. Works exactly as mentioned in the product description. Great for those who boil eggs regularly. This feedback is based on 2 months of use.,Liked the design...boils eggs effortlessly,compact and easy to use. Setting available for boiling eggs. Good product.,I love the ease with which I can boil eggs, without wasting much time or money on gas bills,Good. Current problem in water,I would say not a bad purchase. As the size is small it can hot hold lot of hot water but still very handy for kitchen. If used with very moderate tap speed, it can give you moderate warm water continually which is a plus. Should give it a try if looking for cheaper and best option for kitchen use.,It\\'s very easy to install & sufficient warm water for kitchen . Sufficient warm for bath also . Value for money. First day usage review.,The product was very bad because curent pass in body so don\\'t purches this product,The portable geyser is awesome and i used today the whole day  and in 9 degree temperature if u get continous running hot water in kitchen nothing is best ,i really really loved it,must must purchase it,thank you so much for such a useful product👍👍😊😊,Easy to hang.It can be hanged at any place.,very bad product not ,work even 3 months, as well as seller is not supporting in warranty,I liked the size. It is light and easy to install. Value for money,Good product and very good working,Finally, I got the right induction cooktop I am searching for. Amazon basic is the best in class. Fast heating, no words. Superfast delivery by Amazon.,I like the various temperature controlbuttons.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711QV0gr-vL._SY88.jpg,works fine only till warranty period... immediate poor functioning after that,This Amazone brand induction cook top is of good quality and easy to use. Price is very reasonable.,Good for light cooking.. It\\'s good but it\\'s a little weak at the end also, sometimes starts on its own with batteries without touching the button,I love it! So good for my go to morning coffee... It works just like milk frothed of a real coffee machine,Not working after some days,Good quality productNyc coffee beater and very easy to use.,Good quality product at this price,Easy to available in market at 150. Overpriced and average build quality.,Value for money product this product is quite good and effective I love it\\'s quality,Mixes well, product quality is good at this price After going through many reviews and checking multiple brands, decided to settle with Philips AC2887/20. Not sure how accurate is the PMI number it is displaying, but we can feel a noticeable difference after using it for over a month. Cleaning the filters also easy. Overall I\\'m happy with the product.,Highly recommend, so much so that i bought another one. It\\'s been 1 month and just had to wash the first filter once and works very nicely....everyone in the house is breathing nicely and clearly,Monitors the pm level in the Air exactly. When I installed it in the kitchen, the pm level went up as soon as the cooking started and the purifier automatically switched to higher speed and brought it down. During KARTHIGY, when everyone was cracking crackers the PM level went up in the purifier indicating increase in air pollutants,Great product, no issues and work very efficiently,Easy to install, no noise. And air Clean quickly.,I did not receive an Invoice and there is no serial number marked on the product. I am unable to initiate any request with the Manufacturer.,It reduces pollution indoor but take time,Good purifier with almost no noise and Good display of impurities in air I was very impressed by the quality of this basket - I found it sturdier than Cello brand\\'s laundry basket. I ordered one more basket in black but unfortunately the finish of the product on the inside wasn\\'t smooth. I wanted to store washed laundry in the second one but the basket\\'s interior didn\\'t have a smooth finish - had scratches and plastic sticking out that could damage delicate clothes. I returned the second one. I am deducting a star because my second purchase experience wasn\\'t good. I might buy the same product again in the hope that I get a product of the same quality as my first purchase.Update after ordering the basket for the third time - The third basket\\'s rim was bent so I couldn\\'t fit the lid but the baskets finish was perfect. I persevered and requested and exchange and on the fourth attempt, I finally got a good quality basket for storing washed laundry.,Plastic quality is good sturdy build overall good purchase reasonable pricing,Cover could be fit better,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/613anWf4JBL._SY88.jpg,Good capacity but bad finishing and bit pricey. Cheap quality too.,Good but not any packing,It does the job. The capacity is huge and you can easily store 1 week\\'s laundry. The top is detachable,The lid of the basket is not that strong and ite just comes out all the time and I have to fix it again and again. You have to get used to changes in flavours as compared to fried foods. Device is easy to use and clean.,Best product for chicken roast,Good product but the capacity is sufficient only for nuclear families. And you will need to cook/ grill 2_3 times, can\\'t do it at one go.Damaged packaging, so check thoroughly before use.The product us useful beyond  a doubt, needs very little oil.,Now, it\\'s been 1 month for using this Airfyer and overall experience is good. Buy only when you are healthy diet specific and nonveg would be a plus as for veg , it could be limited dishes you can prepare.,Very good product👍,ONE OF THE BEST BUY EVER.... AND OF COURSE THE BRAND,Made by air fryer...awsome product.,Quick to use and worth the money. Like and happy,,Please don\\'t buy this heater, it stopped working in just 2 days.... And not able to return the product also... Waste of money Takes space and not convenient if in a hurry. The handheld model would be better suited and more useful for frequent use.,I used this product once after reading the manual. The first impression after using it on 3 cotton shirts without starch and one pant is pathetic. None of the shirts got wrinkle free on full steam, hence you could guess what it would be in trousers.Later I found it is satisfactory on silk, nylon shirts, T shirts etc but none will get an iron effect. Wrinkle will be there in small amount and a slight wet feel when the steam cool down but it will go if fast.It is mainly useful for ladies who wear embroidered nylon, silk materials, stone work fabrics, etc etc men who use T shirts and nylon rich trousers. Otherwise, don\\'t even think of buying it. In my case, I use cotton whites and white trousers mainly at office as I am a lawyer. Hence, for me, it is totally useless. No females at home and hence, it is another product that grab my home space.Regarding comfort while using it, I would say, I am totally disappointed as the board behind it is not much of use while using g shirt because of its size which is not that long. The last two button downwards will always hard to press it to board and we have to take the hanger hold high on one hand and thus another difficult part as the nylon material needs another hands to hold it firm. Secondly, the long full sleeves are totally difficult to do it though steam is applied, the wrinkles won\\'t go easily add we are not pressing it to board and it will always go here and there. The top stand is a hanger shaped but the clips attached as useless as the board comes in between. For trousers, the product itself won\\'t work good. So if we use the hanger it comes with, you need to put the switch off, place the handle in slot, take the shirt out and then only we can use the back side to steam after waiting again to steam up switch on etc otherwise steam will go on coming out of it.Any way, the product is more useful that those similar without a pressing board.The next negative thing is, manual says, for better lasting of product, and  to avoid decalcification, the water After use should be drained and cleaned. Hence, it means, you can\\'t use it daily morning in rush while going to office. That needs little time. At the same time you can\\'t press all dress in a stretch and can\\'t fold it like we do with iron box. It won\\'t work that away. So if you have long large cupboard with hangers as in mansions, you can try that.In effect, buy it if you find exceptions and usages apart from what I mentioned above.P.S :- I am seriously thinking of OLX 😒,Received a broked packedge. With broken item.,I thought it would make my task of ironing easy but it’s useless on cottons and silks . It’s great to use it on chiffon and polyester. Do not buy thinking you won’t need standard ironing anymore..,It is fantastic for marriages, where there are many dresses, net based where you can\\'t use iron. Quick. Good for suits,It looks like an imitation product , pieces don’t match properly and some look very weak,valu Ed for money,It’s not effective and pressing clothes effectively seems to have an issue Very isedul to chop veggies in a very short time. Elders in family use it very easily to help cooking. Much time saving one,Good and sturdy,Very nice quality...got the same product as mentioned... Very much happy about the results I\\'m getting of it.. quality product. Must go for it...,I gifted it to mom, and she lives it. She only complain about cleaning. But plus point is it got nice sharp blade.,The plug provided with the machine for power connection is of poor quality. It is loose when plugged into an electric socket. One quality should be improved. As it is , it is NOT according to ISI or international standards. This is a ‘C’ class item and the poor quality reflects very poorly on the quality control system of the manufacturer.,Easy to use and super easy to clean,Just absolutely very good go for it,Best part easy to use.. chopped every vegetable very smoothly.. Smoothies and dry grinding.Consumes less space.,most third class product.. motor is not able to take load and everytime smoke comes out..service is too bad..dont buy this product..its after 10 months feedback,I received the product and the rotor blade along with the washer came off the grinder jar in the demo itself. Exchanged the product and received a piece which had scratches on it (the lid of the big jar, the body of the big jar), the blender lid doesn\\'t seem to quite be leakproof... Because of my first experience with wonderchef product, i definitely had high expectations about the quality, and I would say that it did not fulfill my expectations. I had bought it for dhanteras and the exchange and all delayed the plan, also was a lot disappointing for me. Now I am anxious to even use the exchanged one, already the scratches have put me off.,It is very easy to clean .,👌,there is no switch ,Its very difficult to use without switch in the mixi,Easy to use, easy to clean, space saver, handy,I used this product for making puree.Totally waste of purchase.One jar not working. The product is quite small.. easy to learn and light weight.. working fine..the only sad thing is no warranty card given..Machine cover also for machine is good.. the free kit is also good..,Machine is excellent for beginners. However the package was missing the sewing kit. Many people have complained about a broken box but for me the entire sewing box is missing.,Little difficult to get bobbin thread out from the machine, saree pheeko is task, maximum of times saree get stuck in the bobbin area, used for basic stitching, company has not provided any demo at doorstep, as they are not serviceable for few pincodes. Need to learn on YouTube only. Ok ok product, need lot of patience initially for beginners,Only for the brand name we spent this much. Better buy a cheap one if you are a rarely user and beginner,Amazing product. Precise stitching and very handy. Loved it.,It\\'s very useful to all .,Quality good,Didn\\'t get warranty card and fabric is not moving Quality product but not very useful as far as ironing is concerned.,Delivery was on time as mentioned by amazon - so keep it up.The Product is kind of gift so not having much info or data in hand but whatever is shared I put it on here.The product is used twice so limited information at presentThe product is just OK.It is NOT a replacement to Iron and cannot be considered so. Yes, the steam is somewhat better than Philips as the user has used Philips also but as compared it should have been price competitive.Well - yes, it is able to remove crease from Jeans and even T-Shirt.We prefer stiff shirts for office wear so no good for Formals or Casual Shirts neither that good for pants.The water filler should have been round shape being a conical shape it does not give idea as to what level the water has been filled.Based on the water container it can steam 2 to 3 clothes at a time. Also, after 2 to 3 clothes the hand get pain. So, you cannot steam more garments.Also, you need some kind of support at the back - just hanging on the Hanger is not enough. The Manufacturer should have given a though on this and could have added an accessory either free of cost or at additional charge.Well so - If I get more information I will update, and change based on the same.,Good not best,I like the product but the only drawback i found is:A) according to the water capacity tank, in just about 5 min of usage you have to refill. So that way for each cloth you have to refill the tank.B) it\\'s quite heavy. So i don\\'t recommend this for long use. If you want to steam 1-2 clothes than its fine. Also the cloth must not be hung up above your height other wise it will be painful for you to hold this heavy steamer above causing more pain .My tip is that place the steamer on a table & after pressing on the steam button once the steam gets coming out you can hold your clothes & swiftly move in front of the steam (2 inches away) that way you will save yourself from the pain of holding it. Also pls use a plastic hanger & never steam over a metal surface :),https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Cp+L1+vIL._SY88.jpg,It is a nice product but only reason I gave 4 star is that it becomes too heavy when it is held with water filled in the bottle.,It\\'s only 2 days we used this product. However it\\'s awsome and really a great worker when it comes to ironing. It\\'s effortless and very quick.,If you want to purchase a steamer, go for it. It weights around 850gm without 250ml water, so the only concern is weight and how long u can hold it in your hand during steaming process. Otherwise performance wise this is by far the best machine available. Quality and finishing of the product are also very good. Certainly recommended. I liked that it is so convenient to carry,Waste of money. Defective product, cheap quality. doesn’t blend at all,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IVsjyZ13L._SY88.jpg,First charge problemSecond motor proble,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61aXXxIxPwL._SY88.jpg disadvantages:- a transparent jar does not sit tightly.  even after replacing the first mixer.  The second replacement came exactly the same.does not seem to affect the work.Makes smoothies great! I hold the bowl with my hand, but without a hand it keeps fine.- There were scratches on the metal glass.  But after replacing , an undamaged product arrived. The metal glass sits tightly.  The kit has everything.  Juice has not yet been made.  I will add a review later.,Excellent Product....Very good Juicer machine for all fruits and vegetables.Easy to use and very helpful.,Waste collection portion is not fitting well. During use some of waste product of fruit is coming out....,Best juicer for carrot , beet root and other vegetables and fruits , best motor , don’t compare with other brands , this is the best product made in India , just go for it,900 watt motor really powerful...very good for jucie extraction.,A very good product, its better than any juicer and is multi purpose. The one with all three attachments is recommended as it will cater to more kitchen functions.,Best company or product,Very Like Product and Service Review-Buying price 8999 during prime day sale with 10% discount from HDFC DEBIT CARD.PRODUCT REVIEW!RATING 4/5This is a new model launched during prime day from Eureka Forbes Aquaguard line of products named Aquasure delight.The product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of 7.5l on paper but holds only 7 liters of water, equipped with reverse osmosis, ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solids(can be manually adjusted only by service engineer!), the 7 liter tank fills at about 30 mins but the water wastage is very high for every 1litre water purified there is a drainage of 1-1.5 litre from the drain pipe (please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing, shaving or watering plants. The drained water is same as tank water just with higher TDS). The water taste varies according to the level of TDS you choose very low TDS will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which I will not recommend. The default TDS after purification is set somewhere between 80-100 (drinking water should have TDS below 300)MANUFACTURER REVIEWRATING 2/51)The manufacturer of this product is Eureka Forbes I am giving a rate of 2/5 because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that I received was a defective one. The drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full, I asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so I received a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OUT OF THE BOX! I ordered for a replacement on Amazon which they processed and I got another one in which the led lights were displaced I don\\'t know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect I would have been disappointed for the second time but I observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside. The replaced product\\'s valve is functional and now operating without any hassle!SERVICE REVIEW0/5Don\\'t expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache. The reasons are1. The people Eureka Forbes has employed as technicians are thieves, I am saying this because Aquasure Delight comes with INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE, this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the Aquaguard inlet! as I hadn\\'t opened the package when it arrived! (because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product, mostly electrical items that need installation like TV\\'s Washing machines) Taking the precaution I didn\\'t open the box so I was unaware that DIVERTER is included in the package! The technician after fitting the diverter charged Rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package. i came to know this when I opened the package of the replaced product and found THE DIVERTER INCLUDED ALONG and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some don\\'t. I still have to confirm this with Eureka Forbes!2) The pre filter doesn\\'t come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices, My technician sold it to me at Rs 950 which is available at Amazon at Rs 750 but then if had ordered it from Amazon I have to install it by myself. I don\\'t have a drill etc so I had to pay him Rs 950 so loss of Rs 400 on the technician. My opinion on this is that Eureka Forbes SHOULD SELL WATER PURIFIERA WITH PRE FILTER even though it raises the cost of the product by Rs 700 to Rs 800PLATFORM REVIEW!2/5The platform in which I bought is of course Amazon I am giving it a rating of 2/5 because I received a defective product the first time and Amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by Amazon (Amazon never raises an installation request unlike Flipkart which raises an installation request from its side, which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation Flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem) For installation you have to call the Eureka Forbes toll free number and raise an installation request, so Amazon representative was demanding an INSTALLATION REPORT, a video or photo proof of the problem, now how could I make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video I got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as I found it defective to put it up for replacement but I didn\\'t know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product!SUMMARY1) PRODUCT IS GOOD FOR THE MENTIONED PRICE!2)AQUASURE COMES WITH \"INTEGRATED DIVERTER VALVE\" A STAINLESS STEEL DEVICE THAT IS ATTACHED TO YOUR WATER OUTLET AND THE AQUAGUARD, DON\\'T LET YOUR TECHNICIAN CHARGE YOU FOR IT.3) THE TECHNICIAN WILL OVERCHARGE YOU FOR PRE FILTER BE READY FOR THAT.4) TECHNICIANS ARE CUNNING AND MOSTLY THIEVES SO BE SHARP AROUND THEM.5) MAKE SURE PRODUCT IS NOT DEFECTIVE IF IT IS AMAZON IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME REPLACING IT.6) AMAZON WILL NOT RAISE AN INSTALLATION REQUEST YOU HAVE TO RAISE IT BY YOURSELF BY CALLING EUREKA FORBES CUSTOMER  CARE!OVERALL VERDICT- 2.5/5,if your family in 4 members you have choice eureka Forbes delight RO+UV+TDS this product is very effective and efficient. Agua guard provides installation with in 24 hours of delivery. before the installation had TDS level is  125, and after the installation had TDS level is 62. Nice product by Aquaguard, water taste is also sweet.,This is very good water purifier but I see service guy for installation seems in hurry. He just installed and went off. He did not show how much is TDS, how to adjust it. Don\\'t buy this product on Amazon. Buy it from local stores if possible.,I purchased this product on a heavy Festival discount. There was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob. I reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged. Although I had to wait for about two weeks. The Serviceman came and installed another piece. Since then it is working excellently. In all, the best part was that the services were good and responsive.,Amazon part of the business was smooth.Delivery done within timelines. Payments, exchange, cashback all done hassle free.Eureka Forbes another story.For installation I had to call them daily for 7 days.Finally on escalation and on hold with Eureka Forbes customer service for close to 90 minutes, installation was done.Eureka Forbes now calls me every other day to force this review.My main reason for writing this review.,I got the Purifier installed and before that I was having Bislery water (reason why I have so many bottles which thankful came handy). The Deliver and Installation was smooth. After installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the 1st batch of filtered water since it\\'s the 1st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall.So I decided to let it full up and once it was full, I turned off the switch so no more whater comes in. I used the empty 2L Bislery bottles to fill up the 1st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around 6L as Mentioned by the Company.After I emptied the Filter to its last drop, I turned on the filter with another set of Empty bottles at the waste pipe side. It took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost 13.2 L worth of bottles as seen in the image. This is roughly 220% or more than twice the amount of filtered water.Now the company claims 60% water saved in comparison to other RO+UV filters and I have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do. But I think it\\'s a bit much regardless.Fir every ~6L of purified water, it wastes ~13L.My tal water TDS is ~470Filtered water TDS is ~86And the waste water TDS is ~640Maybe it\\'s because of the TDS levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and it\\'s possible that the amount might vary for different TDS levels at source.But I recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down. 13L almost everyday wasted is 390L per month and this is considering you only filter 6L of water per day.I\\'ll redo this once more to see if there\\'s any difference in values. This is juts to keep the potential buyers informed.,I like speed to fill water n less wastage. I like Tds adjuster and easy to install . I don’t like internal plastic body though I believe it’s steel.. need confirmation. Overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from 3-4 weeks,Deserve a 5 star on product. However, ran into a problem when it comes to installation. The technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation. At last one technician came forward. been 2 months since i got these i can slowly see the fabric coming off and the bare cardboard peeking through. but it depends on how you handle it in my opinion. but they can be folded flat and stored in tiny spaces which is great!!,Cost high but good,Super,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Pr+tjoxEL._SY88.jpg,A very good thing to keep casual clothes.....,Ave been using it for a month now and this is the current condition,Very nice product :),Good to store items This is aesthetically the most appealing Digital Kitchen scale out of the available choices. Though it is also by far the most expensive, it is value for money considering the followig pros:1. Functionality: It has only two touch buttons which integrate all the functions like Units of weight & volume, multiple tare & weigh with overload indication, and off/on; It can give volume idications for water and milk, two of the most frequently used liquids, while other liquids can be also measured if a glass of water is calibrated for a certain volume, say 100 ml ad same is marked on the glass; The plastic food grade bowl fits snugly on the scale and also doubles up as a cover when the scale is not in use2. Duraility: Because of its squat oblong shape and sure footing, the scale wont topple. Also, since bowl fits snugly on the scale upside down when the scale is not being used, it prevents dust from entering the display and buttons; material is tough plastic with a recessed top which seats the bowl firmly and there is no exposed space for ingress of any spilt liquid, With all this, theres a one year warranty extendable to two years, which speaks about the confidence of the manufacturers in their own design3. Battery Life: The device has an auto power off and a digital display which consumes very less power. Hence battery is likely to last longer.I only encountered two cons:1. Scale is very sensitive and takes some time to settle2. The display backlight goes away after some time and the lcd reading is difficult to read in bright ambient light.Overall, this device serves my purpose of practical diet management very efficiently and effectively and am sure it will grow on me. Recommended if you want to get much more utility and eficiency at a slightly higher price.,Litt to adjust all time,,Ok. Price wise it didn\\'t last long Best,Only issue is that you might misjudge its size. It\\'s kind of too big, especially if you\\'re living in hostels, like me. Using it for anything other than boiling water usually turns out to be pretty inconvenient for that reason. Even washing it at times. But overall quality is really good. It\\'s a good product, only suitable for specific use cases though. Good for homes.,The kettle is very handy to use and the capacity of it makes the work easier. I loved the new colour choices they are offering.,the size is sufficient and may be a bit large for single person usage. one suggestion is that a temperature control knob could have been provided in this price range. otherwise a very good product. finish is excellent.,Takes a little longer duration for boiling,The problem is the outer of kettle, which easily charms the dust - smudge, & no matter whatever available kitchen cleaning products u apply, the blotch stains are signified to be permanent. Go for other than white colour.,Very useful product and it is working good. Price is reasonable. Worth it.,Like the metal base. The decision to buy  this2)Purely on The cost of similar branded item  is around Rs16000 =002)I  use this Vacuum cleaner only occasionally and based on my need and I  feel floor requires vaccum cleaning.Under the above condition this item serves purposeConssMade In  China and they importing and marketing in India1) sound I feel not at my comfort zone but others also make similar noise2) lenth of power chord smaller compared to other brander ones3)  No demo was arranged .

There can be an improvement in the sponge quality, since while using the blower the same gets sucked in the steel tub. Further if the company can provide a video on how to effectively use the product it would be great and also how to avoid pressure on the motor since the hose pipe bends while using the product.,nice product. i liked suction power but on right side  extra blowing out apart from blower side. i dont why ? and steel body build quality is too low. if small partical touch it ll get dent .its ok over all product is good.  ok ok,The suction power of the vaccum cleaner is really good only drawback is that after using it for some time I observed that the suction hose is leaking the air which is making a whistling sound. I tried reaching out the customer service and they informed me that the whistling sound when using the blower mode is quite normal. The outer container is made of steel and is of good quality. When I received the product I observed a dent in the body.,Bought recently and initial usage is quite good. It\\'s convenient and easy to use. Performs well on floors, mattress and sofas. Blower function works as expected. A bit tough to clean mosquito mesh through grills.,I have been using this vaccume cleaner for the last 1 month. And I am very happy with the product ...I have been using it mostly for Sofa Cleaning....it\\'s suction power is really good.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/61yO-rOjccL._SY88.jpg,Suction pipe should have more length, can\\'t reach slabs, other wise nice It\\'s very easy to use. And easy to clean. It does it\\'s jób as described. Only drawback is that, the motor unit heats up v very quickly🥵, even with very little use. I have only used this product twice so far, so I can\\'t speak for its durability. Also the price has been dropping steadily on this product.  Wondering why🤔.Only time will tell, how long this product will last.,Awesome built quality with perfect packaging,Blender is working good.,Working good till now,Easy to use,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71prBn8iSuL._SY88.jpg,Easy to clean n all .,I make a lot of sauces, purees, and dressings. I use my blender almost every day. But the construction of the blender is such that the food often falls below the blades and I am constantly readjusting the ingredients to get the ingredients blended. It can take a considerable amount of time and a lot of patience. But this immersion blender can puree fruits and vegetables in less than 2 minutes and do it evenly and consistently. It is easy to use and lightweight. Cleaning consists of removing the shaft with the blades and handwashing it. You can wipe off the handle with a damp cloth and stick both in a drawer. My standard blender requires thorough washing of the various parts (pitcher, blades, screw on attachment, and lid). So I am moving the standard blender from the counter to storage. If I need it I have it. I highly recommend this Powerful blender, go for it. It\\'s good product you can face challenge in starting but once you learn this is easy you can sew clothes from anywhere you want.,The product works well. We can use for quick fixes. Option to use power adapter is very useful.Cons: Can\\'t change direction of stitchCant stich fabric in middle if it\\'s big.. only edges can be stitched comfortably.Add ons, especially the threader, given are very flimsy,Its an ok ok product easy to use but you have to put knot to hold the stitches together. Portable and good for emergency purpose,It\\'s good overall just it need to be tied everytime u sew it\\'s really smooth working and good quality of the thread....,Ok,Nice product... Budget friendly... worth it,Not so easy to use,Easy to use Light weight steam iron is very useful,Very good,Very good quality. Light weight, Fantastic product and it matches the product description and features that was shown in the review.,Best product,It\\'s very useful and easy to handle. It gives fine finish.,Ease of use,Great,Buyers, pl. note, this iron comes with 16Amps plug, which won\\'t fit in many homes. I had to return due to this reason. Other-wise, product looks pretty good. After about a month of usage this is an over all a good product from Inalsa, here are the key highlights:1.  Has dual speed options to chop onions/tomatoes for tadka and also make purees/chutnies etc. Does both effortlessly.2. Powerful 400 watt motor cuts through onions like a hot knife through butter.3. Easy to clean as the blades can be separated from the main jar.Thanks,Very useful and handy for daily kitchen needs.Reasonable price.,Excellent product. Love u,Good product,The product works good, and powerful too. The box arrived damaged. But product ain’t. Good value for the money.,Good product, motor quality is heavy, just concerned about jar, I request company to make it available on Amazon.,Excellent product with heavy bowl powerful motor makes it easier to chop vegetables in few seconds,This is a very good kitchen accessory for every household\\'s needs. helps to chop and cut vegetables quickly. I have used other choppers in the past; this has a much better cut performance. Over all good, Easy to use.*But do remember there is no existing button to set Hard, medium and soft boil. Its totally depend on how much you have fill water level.Like 50ml for Hard boil,It just different way to fool people to show up Soft, Medium and Hard boil facility.,Good product and does the job as advertised. Autocut off is there, but the power switch doesn\\'t turn off automatically. it should be done manually which we can forget. Once cooled down, this will turn on even water is not there. so switching off is mandatory. i have kept a smart plug with 20mins count down to overcome this issue.,Overall it is a good equipment to boil eggs. But there should have been 1 change in button. It says automatic off, but machine is not really off... It will restart again when machine cools down because power button was kept on.. Button should turned off automatically to avoid restart. Hence 1 star less.,,Used three times so far, boiled 8 eggs each time, and perfect results each time.  Very happy with the product.  Will provide long term review after couple months.  Thanks Amazon.  Thanks Borosil.,Easy to use product,Eggs r clocked perfectly. Follow the manual properly then it will be easy to use.,A very user friendly products. Makes boiled eggs very quickly. Also the feature of making poached eggs is useful.Overall a very good product. A great product of convenience. The only drawback being the heating or grilling time seems to be a little more after regular use than it was when brand new. But otherwise a great product to reduce all the hustle!!,Came with a small scratch on the casing and box was not sealed. Otherwise it\\'s OK,Pros:1. Good brand value2. Two year warranty3. Easy operation4 . Evenly cooked food.5. Decently priced.Cons:1. Weight distribution is not even. Tumble when press on handle.2. Cut off time is confusing, mostly power cut before food is fully cooked.3. There is no locking for griller4. No power regulatorOver all it\\'s a good buy for domestic use.,,The product is great but its size isn\\'t good. I\\'m not able to cook even 1 jumbo bread sandwich in it. The bread comes out of the griller, and some part of sandwich is left uncooked.,Works fine. No issues.,I am in love with this Griller toaster! It is so sleek and compact in design with complete ss finish for safety use. Food is cooked in minutes because of 1000 watt. It is so good! I frequently grill my veggies, paneer, etc on this . Comes with auto cut feature to avoid food from burning,Good in griling its 1000 w so fast griling.but one problem power cord lenght is too short. 1) Cord Length could be increased little more (~5cm-10cm) because Medium Bucket size is adequate for Covering of Cord length for water up to 60% of water in bucket2) Excellently Easy to Use for old people (above age of 75) also3) Hope, Durability is Good for the Price4) Price is Too Expensive when Compared with other Top Brands (So, Hope will not come to Repair easily as compared to other brands),I mean it\\'s a water heating rod right.?? So obviously I\\'m gonna use it to heat water for bathing,Good,Shoke proof,Good product,Ok,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71IMDaS7AaL._SY88.jpg,They are saying it is shock proof. but in user manual they said don\\'t put your hand in water while heating. i don\\'t understand what how they are claiming it as shock proof. Handy but no carpet cleaning. Stops in 10-15 min of continuous use..takes another 10 min to cool and restart...ok for cars  may be. The filter cleaning is difficult. I returned my product.,The equipment trips very frequently due to overheat. It\\'s happening almost every 5 minutes, and takes Upton 30 mins to cool down. Not a good product.,It’s mostly used for cleaning sofa and bed corners. It’s getting hot very fast and getting tripped.,This product is very helpful in cleaning.,Easily operate and many function so easy clean every corner and whole place,Hi Heat,Liked,Helpful it is not useful in Winter as the water is coming normal temperature.,,There\\'s no support for the product . You will not get the warranty. It should be mention somewhere.,Very nice,I have ordered it again, i am using the last one from last two years. Working very well and take least space and very compact,छोटे परिवार के लिए सही है ज्यादा पानी वालों के लिए नहीं,Good,Quality of the product is not as I expected. I does not warm the water as it should be. I bought 5ltr 3kw model 10 days before Provides hot water just below boiling temprature 80°-95°C in 4-5min if provided mild cold tank water and auto cutoff after reaching hot temprature,Pipes/installation/plug not included installation is 350 +18℅= 413 rs and i also paid 440rs hefty amount for 2 18inches steel pipes which I bought from installing engineer which is much higher than market pipe rate(200-250rs) better buy it from market if you buy this gyeserAlso there was no MRP on pipes wrapper provided by engineerSo be ready to spend 700 - 1000 rs extra if you want to buy this gyeser even though your bathroom is fitted with angle valves and other gyeser fittings.Till now not tested in extreme cold weather of january starting in which no sunlight + temprature drops below 5°C in my area I am from middle up region,I bought 5ltr 3kw model 10 days before Provides hot water just below boiling temprature 80°-95°C in 4-5min if provided mild cold tank water and auto cutoff after reaching hot temprature,Pipes/installation/plug not included installation is 350 +18℅ also = 413 rs and i also paid 440rs hefty amount for 2 18inches steel pipes which I bought from installing engineer which is much higher than market pipe rate(200-250rs) better buy it from market if you buy this gyeserAlso there was no MRP on pipes wrapper provided by engineer charge 850/- he said company not provide instaltion bill,Good product enjoying with the performance... Hindware mechanics charging too much and force to pay the amount else warranty is not available... It is too much... No 3pin plug and water hose supplied... If hindware charge the fixing charges at the time of order is fine,Look is Good this Hindware gysar ,I have faced problem with wire is very short and  three pin plug set not given.I am using from last one month working condition is Good.Instantly water heating is good.,5 Lt XCEED geyser is very good heats water very fast one drawback is installation is not free I had to pay Rs 370 extra while I bought my own plug and conecting pipe Amazon hide this thing.,Good product,It\\'s a good product,easy to install and handle This machine can easily brew coffee for a family of 4-6 members at a time. Some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe. The answer is simple \\'NO\\'. Reason is that this isn\\'t a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewer.Now my experience with this machine was good. And a bad thing was that I did not get the steam pipe sleeve. Except that, everything was well packed. When you buy this machine, make sure to rinse the internal passage. throw the first water from the machine. thoroughly wash the caraffe, puck, filter and measurement spoon. Remember to NEVER USE dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe, puck or anything such. It may ruin the coffee aroma.Method (efficient as per my opinion):1. Fill the water in tank. No need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector. Don\\'t run it dry. It may damage the heating element or pump.2. Switch ON the machine. After that, pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter, level it and press it to compress. I use 1:2 ratio. 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output.3. Before changing over to drip mode, open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built. Placing carafe under the puck, slowly move the selector till Europa, and quickly back it to steam icon. This will let the coffee bloom inside. After 5-7 seconds, slowly move the selector upto Espresso. The decoction should be not too slow or not too runny.4. Wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode.5.  Take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk. Place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus. Slowly open the steam valve located at the side. Steam it as per your need.6. Mix the milk and decoction. That\\'s itRemember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside. Open the steam valve and let all the pressure get released.Coffee used: Bombay Island Espresso grind Medium Roast. Use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind. Don\\'t use Aeropress, V60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired taste.I personally like this machine. For the price it\\'s good and build quality is Moderate. Please watch some YouTube videos if you are new to coffee machines. It\\'s very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge. You may also watch James Hoffmann. He is World Barista Champion and shares tips about coffee.,I\\'m a fan of espresso. Every time I go to a coffee joint, I tend to order a doppio( A double shot espresso). But, those prices are way too high if I wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday. So, I\\'ve decided to buy this machine. One thing to say, the quality and durability depends on the user. If you take care, the machine would take care of your cup of joe.So, how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing.1. Always rinse the drip tray2. Use 10% dish washing liquid with 90% water to clean the carafe3. Do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds. Run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds. This is crucial because dents can affect quality4. Before and after your brewing activities, make sure that you clean the internals. To do this, fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water.  Assemble an empty perma-filter.  Switch on and set the strength to max. In about a minute, you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe. Check its color. If it\\'s yellow, then rinse and repeat. If it is white, dry everything and switch it off. Then, either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day.5. Always let the steam out. When you froth milk, immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothWARNING: NEVER EVER USE HARD/TAP WATER. IT CAUSES SERIOUS LIME-SCALING ISSUES WHICH CAN GREATLY AFFECT THE TASTE, QUALITY OF YOUR COFFEE. IT MAY ALSO CAUSE DIGESTIVE ISSUES. ALWAYS USE SOFT-CAN WATER(THE WATER MUST NOT TASTE SALTY OR SWEET).  TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. PLEASE DO NOT POST MISLEADING REVIEWS STATING THAT MY MACHINE BROKE.THE STEAM KNOB IS THE WORST PART OF THIS MACHINE. THE MACHINE WAS USED JUST FOR 14 DAYS. THEN, THE STEAM KNOB DECIDED TO LOOSEN UP AND FALL OFF. I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT THERE. THE PROBLEM IS I\\'M JUST 17, AND I CANT DRIVE. AND THE SERVICE CENTER IS FAR AWAY. SO, I REMOVED THE RUBBER CASKET AND FIXED THE KNOB DIRECTLY. IT COMES OFF, BUT I THINK I\\'LL USE IT ONLY TO EASE THE PRESSURE, BECAUSE I ALWAYS DRINK IT BLACK. BUT THIS ISSUE MAKES ME REDUCE A STARTips for using the machine.1. Use fine grounded coffee. I use Narasu\\'s PB or Royal Elite Bold. Currently,  I\\'m using Phalada Pure & Sure Organic Coffee Powder. For the best results, you must grind the coffee on your own. If you can\\'t make sure the coffee is fresh. Mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster, both for the machine and your stomach respectively. You can also go for Lavazza. But, it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the Mariana Trench.2. Only use good quality bottled/can water.3. Maintain a good cleaning discipline4. In case you\\'ve used hard/tap water, immediately do a descaling. Refer your instruction manual.5. Always tamp your ground in the filter. You must apply about 30 pounds of force. This is about 13 kg of force. Hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it. Make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisAs you can see, this is a real espresso maker. It produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee. For me, it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot. This is good for a steam driven machine. Note that this is a steam driven machine. You can never get the finish of coffee joints, because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps. Although the tastes would be similar, provided you use the correct beans.Please look at the pics  to see the finish. The cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old. The brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder I\\'ve just bought. Can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness? This applies even to taste. The white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth. The brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best, leaving a crisp and nutty taste. Also, after I did some research, I came to know that an espresso must have three layers. A bitter crema, a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom. You must mix these before drinking to have the best shot. If you see the glass picture I\\'ve attached , you can clearly see those layers.OVERALL, THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MACHINE FOR A BEGINNER. IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO AND IT IS ECONOMICAL TOO. AS I SAID, IF YOU TREAT THE MACHINE WELL, THE MACHINE WOULD TREAT YOUR CUP OF JOE WELL.,Being a coffee enthusiast, the product fits in my requirement.Easy to use. Time taken is reasonable. Adjustment of intensity works well.Frothing tool is very good... though i prefer black coffee, frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guests.,Nice product,The coffee strength nob is a mythBut itne paise me itna is good,Very happy with the machine, works fine and easy to operate, unfortunately it wasn\\'t packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken , everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the box.,It makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult. Also was shocked to know this is not covered under Amazon\\'s return policy. My bad I didn\\'t check and now I am stuck with this. Life is no better after you buy this.,Coffee maker delivered without Warranty Card & Instruction manual Value for money,Bahot achha product he ye,Iron got damaged in just 1 year. While past few months I used before that just using occasionally like 1 time in month. Same uses of grinder. But currently grinder working fine. This review date 30 dec\"22 purchased product at 7th oct\"21.,All product good. I am happy,Good product of life long,Good,,Loud jyada hai It’s a good product and I’m using it since 1 week and it’s performing well,I like the product but the code is small,It\\'s good and easy to use .  Full Paisa wasul hai but cord thoda sa aur bada hona chahiye tha.,Good for hot water in minutes, But it has 2 pin connector .,Velue for money product,Nice product,Good product, fast delivery and ease of use make this a good value for money purchase.,This is good The first one was not working. So got a replacement of the same within 2 days. Thank you Amazon. Now the new one is working but the battery life is not so good.,It is very light, portable, battery life is good and it\\'s blowing fast wind of its capacity.,1.Light weight2.Battery life  •low speed -3hrs  •Medium speed-2hrs  •High speed-1 hr3.Fan speed is much better while it\\'s charging.4.Takes long time to charge5.Overall quality is good and worth the price,Product is awesome. Easy to use. Bettery life is good. Take too time in charging.Price is high on Amazon. You can buy it at 800 from any offline store,Nice good product,Compact and very good look. Looks premium product. Air flow also good and noise level is also ok. Don\\'t look for other fans. Battery backup not yet checked but only one point bad is that full charge you can\\'t findout. There is no indication for full charge.,Pros:Original Bajaj productGood buildLight weight3 speed settingGood air throw for one personCan change fan face both horizontally and verticallyCons:Vibrates, causing fan base to move if not clampedVery very small, so can only cool a part of the body of one personBattery life is 3 hrs, which is too lessClamp isn\\'t big enough for table sidesOverall:Very portable and good for one person. Would have been better if size was a bit bigger increasing cooling surface. No regrets though..,Moneys worth. Innovative design. Can fix it anywhere. Speed is good.  Been using it for 2 months now. Only con is switch is small and at the back. Have to search n adjust speed or switch it off. Light weight,Product is compact and goog looking.Due to light weights sometimes need hard press. Heating is quick but feels inappropriate.Cord sometimes abstract on standby.Not that much effective on cotton which requires hard press.Does lught and quick press job instantly,Good,instructions ( manual) not clear,Using it for a couple of weeks now. No complaints, does it’s job well. Will update my review after using a couple of months.,It\\'s light weight and easy to move,Good but nice product,Every points are ok.,Good Prestige water purifier cartridge is obviously good. But it lasts very less number of days. It doesn\\'t even last more than 2.5 months for 2 people. Also the MRP is cut off and it is sold at a higher price.,This Product normal sediment water filter, but not long use, So All customers you go to electric RO UV Water Purifier, I am suggested v guard, Kent, Havells Brands,I wonder if the product is genuine because the cartridge that came with the filter ran for over a year. After that, the ones i received worked for about 2 months only. I\\'m now looking for a Prestige service center from where i hope to get authentic product.,I order it for my prestige tatva non electric water filter. But it\\'s not working properly. Water is not filtering and company is not giving any solution and saying it\\'s not covered under warranty. My 600 rupees is totally wasted. I\\'m not expecting it from prestige company.,These filter cartridges are replace in three months.,Easy to replacr,All great but it lasts only for like 4-6 months max.,Good Perfect for room heating ..... Noiseless,,Silent instant heating within 30 seconds. Easy to carry just a small suggestion that it should have left and right wind blower also instead of only up and down. Best product not saying it in this range but I have used others also this is the best till date. Even some time we use it as heat massager also as wind flow is awesome so sometime for back pain or knees it\\'s a perfect product. Anyone of buying for the first time or buying for a better experience will recommend to go for this. Its almost 60 days of usage now. And yes easy to clean also. I have a dog and she also enjoys it...,I got a 15 month old used heater, not a new one.The fan is making a too much noise. It is a defective or a damaged piece.I got it on 18th Dec 2022. When I try to request a replacement I am told the return window is closed.If Amazon / Seller is sending a 15 month old used defective product should they at least not have the responsibility to at least get it replaced.,I have been using ptc heaters for a few years now and have been happy with their performance and longevity(usha & orpat).So decided to buy one more this year - saw this one had the highest rating. Bought it. Saw that its basically made by bajaj.Anyway, its good looking and all seemed fine. But i started noticing a flaw with the thermostat. Normally, there is always a hysteresis in the thermostat dial - it turns on at one point and turns off a little further back. But this one was turning On and OFF at exactly the same point. Then i started observing that if the thermostat was on , it simply remained on. If it was off, it remained off. Tried it multiple times and realised that the thermostat doesnt work. So finally returned it.Overall power consumption is as expected - around 1.4KW at low and 2KW at high.,Good,Very nice product.....,good for a room of small size upto 150 sqft, warms rooms within an hour and takes about 2 for a room of 200 sqft. its really light weight and silent in operation. has different settings for fan speed and hot/cold air. the only drawback is that it wont work for a big room or hall area.  overall a good product . Great product light weight n accuracy as of now good n easy to use.... must have in every kitchen,The product looks exactly same like it\\'s shown in pic, wonderful design and also its accurate. I would highly recommend this product for your kitchen.,Nice product and very easy to use. Thanks to Amazon and Gadgetronics.

I weighed some packets with known weight and it showed correct weight. Very useful addition to my kitchen.,Nice product for home use,Easy to use. Accurate, good. Ok,For replacing battery of Purit 23 advanced water purifier. Got what i required.,Good,Very good,I like it,Been using it since 5 years,ok,Nice product Very good product at this price exactly as shown...,Product is good.large storage capacity.the only drawback is that when is opened  it smell like hell.i hv to to sat  them outdoor from my house for 1 day.then they r at least tolerable.otherwise it\\'s very good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FXsvTLNnL._SY88.jpg,Better Size & Nice Design,Good quality better than images.Very fast delivery.,The best purchase I ever had made,Product is good and big enough but price and quality can be little bit improved.,I just now received the box! It was exactly the same as in the description! I loved it! I chose this colour because no mosquitos will be attracted with the light color! Awesome product! Worth buying! It’s good and easy to use,The product appears cheap but works alright. As you might know from the product description, there are speed settings. Decent product for this price range.,Its very nice n poweful, but needs proper care n cleanup after every use, also u should keep changing batteries when u see the power low. Been using it for years now, however 1piece lasts for about a year if taken proper care.,The compartment to insert cells should have been a little bigger. It might break while trying to squeeze the cells in.,,This a useful product.. very easy to use and clean. Looks very light but is of good quality.  Froths milk efficiently.. a must buy if you like frothy coffee or milk .,Waste product.don’t buy this by its brand name or by its price.very delicate product.,This is certainly a great product. Saves time as getting a froth in a conventional way, you need to be very patient. Nowadays everyone needs something quick. This served my purpose. Bought 2 extra that I am planning to gift. Thank you. Writing this review after a month of use.Works absolutely fine, i use it for my tailoring projects. I had a question regarding water dripping bt the company was prompt to send salesman and resolve my queries. Also a tip that I have heard from alot of technician and sounds logical to increase the life of ur machine is to use filter was. Tap water has alot of impurities and gets stuck and reduces the life of iron. I have seen that myself with my other steam iron as it leaves small dust particles on the waterstorage area. So do that will solve leaking issues if u ought to have any,Wanted a heavy steam iron. This works very well. Lots of steam and easily irons out clothes. Very easy on fabrics too so you are able to use the high steam setting to remove out wrinkles on clothes without worrying about the fabric setting too much..,,Easy to Use and All types of Clothes,Nice it\\'s did it\\'s purpose nicely. Happy,,Cup to pour water must have been included,Heat up very quickly, no water dripping, steam is good and don’t stick. I use filter water to keep it clean Ok,The product works very well. The support is also good. The product was not delivered with the required water inlet and outlet connecting pipe and 15A 3 Pin electric plug. Had to run around for procuring them. Wish Bajaj packaged this in the product.,I bought this three months back till now no complaints and using with out any issues.,It\\'s taking time to get hot water,The screw required for installation is missing,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/81YXC87RPYL._SY88.jpg,,Product is good but installation charges are high Good to use,Really good product in this price as compared to other expensive products. Does it\\'s job properly. Roller doesn\\'t come out if you scroll it properly. Adhesive is good in removing febric lints. Doesn\\'t come with a cover but you can keep the used sheet wrapped till next use. Then you can remove it to get fresh sheet.,Easy and handy.,Works, but adhesive could have been better.,It\\'s exactly as the pictures of the product. The roller works well and does the job. Go for it if you need one. I have pets at Home (cats) and I need to use this everyday.Will definitely re-purchase !!,The roller and the frame is loosely tied and cuts hand every time I use. The whole roller disassembles quickly while in use. The adhesion is not very good and finishes when rolled 2-3 times.,I ordered this because my pet’s hairs always stick on my clothes. This product removes those hairs easily. But in one jeans or shirt, you need at least two sheets and also the roller comes down which make cuts on fingers. So for cleaning, really good but not at all easy to use.,Easy-to-use. Can go for it Apart from it leaving a watermark on table, it\\'s been a good experience.,Good product but one issue i found that the head from where cool mist air comes should be flexible to rotate to any direction. Now suppose you are keeping in table and sitting on chair then all cool mist will go above instead of coming to you.,my sleep quality improved by this product and it gives the feeling of freshness.,Operating Manual inadequately written. The 2nd diagram is not labeled, water filling method not mentioned.Most importantly the cord length is too small, why being so thrifty. Most switch boards are at about 5 ft height. Cord does not support this height. As said can be a great product.,Nice product,The quality of the product is normal.  Very thin plastic. Refilling water is a tricky job as we have to fill it up side down. The instructions are not clear. If the product is tilted a little it behaves differently.  The LED lights are delicate and I think loose as well,its an awesome product ...humidifier helped my baby to sleep better due to nasal congestion ... so relieved as a mother, Worth buying for eggetarians,Working great so far!Value for money!4 stars as wire is very short in length!,I like this product and it is worth for money,Very good item,Value for money,Easy to use,Easy to use and easy to handle,It is awsome product,Good qualility,Good product. It\\'s very nice The product arrived on time and in good condition.It is not only portable but also convenient as it uses a standard plug that can be plugged into normal 5Amp sockets.I mostly just use it to heat my bathrooms as its a low wattage heater and thus can only work well in tiny spaces.IMPORTANT! If using in bathroom, ensure there is NO water on the floor or spraying on/around it. Just heat the bathroom and then move away the heater before using the bath area!!!!,It\\'s a light weight easy to use product.Perfect for small space.Heats quickly.,Best room heater in budget, especially it uses less power nd gives sufficient heating, even can be used with inverter in places where power cut is a problematic issue.,Not so easy to use or regular movement.,I liked this room heater. It only uses 500 watts and so can be plugged into any 5 amps. It\\'s quite as there is no fan. Adequate for a small room.,It looks good and the feel is metalic. There is line indicator in its back and also there is a switch on its side. Heating feels powerful and there is no breathing issue due to this heater.,It was Very useful in my Himachal tour in January. I have used it whole night in -5 °C, with few care ie ventilation in room and few waters in room.,good Nice machine for adults at home .. who need small appliance which can do work in jiffy.,,Easy to use,Double blade option works fantastic... Body is sturdy... Chops stuff super fast and super fine...,Very poor qualityNew product refuse to operate,The bottom bowl was not so good enough,Heavy in weight,Good product. As always amazon never disappointes if you are finding best quality product st low price go for it.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/51-YaFM4jHL._SY88.jpg,I like the product.it’s too cheap on Amazon,Good product,Where is pipes ????? It\\'s with gyser as described,Product is good and price is best but it takes half an hour to fully heat 25 litre of water.,Ok,Good product Does the job well,doesn\\'t work on sand. though the suction is very good, the sand stays back no matter which lead you use.,Ok ok,Easy to use product (I used it for the first time without knowing the know-how of its use). Cleans almost 90% of your mess inside the car. Highly recommended.,Pros: look and feel, easy to hold and handle, Cord length, useful led light during night, normal suction power but good enough for general useCons: noise is bit loud, suction power could be better,Good,Hmm,Strudy design, quality accessories,reputated brand.I have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one\\'s where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism, so ofcourse you don\\'t want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it!!!You get what you pay for, I have home vaccum clear from same company with has a good suction and does the job well, I wanted a battery pluggable clearner where I can use it anywhere.Believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars, so if you are expecting a commercial level cleaning the don\\'t buy any.Car vaccum cleaner is a portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not a perfect, I have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it\\'s not good.Mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies, this poor small machine can\\'t handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it\\'s hit but I think I can handle the job, accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine, again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs.,Perfect Good quality but cord is too short .it is ok for sandwiches.,Value for money product, does what it promises. Ceramic coating.Peoduct designers did not make a single sandwich with this. Product usage images and actual usage does not match. The hinge mechanism is flawed and will result in flat sandwiches. If you force the hinge/ clip to shut, it may just break.Poor product design in 2022.,Good Toster and easy to clean,Superb product. Every home should have this product. Especially if you have aged parents, not feeling well. Cooking difficult. Can eat something. Even aged persons/ parents can use it and start their day having a breakfast on time, morning. Evening snack, etc auto power cutoff feature is the greatest attraction, and easy cleaning. Built quality is superb. Most busy persons skip breakfast, you dont have to skip it if you have this product, and a pack of bread, and if there are some vegetables, luxury breakfast with this product,You can make big to small sandwich without any problem,at a time 2 sandwich...but be careful body is weak ,possibility of damage is more.,Pros-1. Ceramic coating & non-toxic.2. Can make 2 jumbo sandwiches at once.3. Takes only 3-4 minutes.Cons-1. Had to manually close it as the height adjuster is small.,The brand vakue is justified. The Product is good , easy to handle,Go ahead and buy, if ubr looking for a trusted griller,Likes the product but cord length is short..had to replace it Good product but price 800-900 ok it\\'s product good,Easy to use, Very Handy.,Auto cut  continue starts fan...which lower down the temp.,I liked the swivelling action to spread the heat,Beat product,,Best room heater.thank you,I received the broken article but there is no replacement service for this product Heater is good for regular sized room, might not work on bigger room or hall but for regular sized room it\\'s heavenly,Like very much.,The hotty model produced by inalsa is sturdy and compact in design easy to handle good quality of cable and fast heating ability with auto cut out system. I had received this product with crack inlet air net however it replaced with new one by inalsa and amazone at ease. It would be added advantage if air deflector be facilitated in this with good quality of indication light. All and all good quality product in this price range,This hotel heater is very light weighted and compact in design, it has a fast heating ability and comes with auto cut out system, its good for a medium size room the blower keeps your room warm for great amount of period, the price is also reasonable overall a great product by Inalsa.,Must have in cold season for small room,Don\\'t buy it go for Amazon brand. No value for money.,Package is damaged but product is in good condition,Reasonable performance for the price no doubt product is good but after 2 month product auto power cut funtion not working so try to claim warrenty but havells said talk to amazon and amazon said talk to havells both the comany raise our hand. by the way product gave 2 year warrenty but they gave me only excusses. very bad experiences with havells. never expected,Its good the ony pro and cons can be the flap ..Pros us can say is that the flap can be used for wider bucket of water for heating Cons u can say is the again the flaps bcoz while not in use flaps must be closed and you can\\'t hang the heater anywhere bcoz there is no option given . Flaps can cause issue bcoz it have to be kept on the ground while not in use ..Rest all is good . Auto cut feature is best,Cord length is shortEnergy efficiency good &Temperature control too good,I realt like the design and auto shutoff features of the product. But there\\'s is also design flaw that you can\\'t insert it into the half filled bucket and water should be full.,Awesome,Very good product,,Energy efficiency is ok not good Overall nice poduct just one problem is that is the cord length only rest awesome. Easy to clean and easy to handle.,We used this for sandwich making and it performed well. The plates for grill and waffle making are readily interchangeable. The cord length is adequate although slightly longer cord would have been great.The device is readily portable because of its size and weight. Overall very useful.!,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cciIOHxUL._SY88.jpg,The quality of product is good,Used a couple of times .....and sandwitch came good,I wanted a sandwich maker and refused to buy one from a store since it was all 2k-4k and didn\\'t have half the features that i was looking for. Saw this and love iBell as an upcoming Indian brand (own an electrical sander too), so didn\\'t think twice and got this. Don\\'t regret it one bit!! Pros are the 3 interchangeable plates for different ourposes. Grill one is just fantastic to hear all kinds of sandwiches and rolls and other food. All the plates are easily removable and washable too. Only con that i saw to this was the latch wasn\\'t properly latching while making a heavily loaded sandwich in the sandwich maker. Otherwise it\\'s a top of the range product in comparison with other big brands!,All the 3 functionalities works pretty well. Only thing is it should have had auto switch off feature. Nevertheless it is a very good product and worth the money. Sandwich also gets made fast.,I ordered vguard removable plates sandwich maker, but it came in faulty. The plates eject button had an issue. Later I ordered this one as was recommended by someone I know. It\\'s of good quality, only that could have been somewhat lower price Bought this almost a month ago, so far it works well. Suction power is above average. Blower feature is a nice addition. Only con is it\\'s a bit loud.,Very nice product.....really amazing,It\\'s very sturdy, wheels are very good so u can take it wherever you want. Electric cable is long.,Deserves the purpose.,Just value for money,good for domestic use,very powerfull motor best product i like it,The product is good honestly i have tested it for cleaning the dry dirt. And in that this works great.Good long power chord and nice attachments that gives the cleaning abmngle a better approach. Not sufficient power,the product is more like a toy for kids. can\\'t use  it as a proper juicer. power back up is very poor.,Ok,I had to replace this product first time because it was leaking and now after replacement the new one has no battery backup and vibrates too much.The MRP is above 2000 rupees which is not at all justfied by the product.After buying the product I found that with the product they are giving a cashback offer of 25 to 100 rs if you give 5 star review, probably that\\'s why it has good ratings. I feel I was fooled by the ratings.,Waste product as the juicer is leaking which creates the whole place mess and the juicer doesn\\'t grind properly where the pieces of fruits remain ungrinded. I generally dont write reviews but i was forced to write this one as this is just waste of moneySpend it wisely for something better,It\\'s does not work properly at all, after charging for 4 hours the battery last only 30 - 45 sec. Very bad product.And they have given a cashback coupon to attract good rating.Misleading information is given on the detail page.,I bought this mostly for milk shake and it does an amazing job and it is affordable but it didn\\'t worked while charging,User friendly blender, very useful for the pg accommodaters. I am using this to make a protein shake from day one when I was received from Amazon. It doesn\\'t make any noise. Speed okay for this price range. Light weight. I don\\'t face\\' any issues in this fan. Over are good.,Good fan from Crompton,Fan was well built and value for money. The noise at the top speed is kinda loud. (can\\'t complain with this price.),Speed control not working,Good,Nice product 👍,Good , while running time slightly shaking . We don\\'t no why .. but it\\'s fixed properly,Good One of the best juicer mixer I have ever used till date. Used almost all renowned brands but this one is class apart. 3rd purchase in the family circle,Nice,It is unique machine it can do everything which we went from a. Juicer machine fine quality of mixing grinder in few seconds and use both domestic or shops and very easy to use and clean I choose it after many machine used it is best all of them.,If u want to take out the juice after several days gap then u can prefer it,bit on the regular basis it is not good because I had taken out mausambi juice from it but it\\'s waste was not containing some juice in it which can give a loss to u.  Else it\\'s good.,I have not used juicer thus, 4 stars. But mixer grinder is excellent. Even hard items like coconut 🥥 pieces grind in just 3-4 turns. Very happy with the product . Easy to clean. Just waiting to use the juicer though.,Very good experience using this produc from year\\'s.,Very nice products and most powerful motor,Nice Machine meets the purpose as I was looking for a strong performing juicer. its just that. manufacturing quality is also good and sturdy. though I feel the motor is loose fitted as one can feel it hitting both sides inside while cleaning or shifting I like the service most and the product,Note: Writing the product right after installation.Product looks nice and the storage capacity is good enough for a family of 5. The technician is very friendly and installed the product without issues. Will write a detailed review after using the product thoroughly.,It\\'s value for money product.Works fine and installation was on time.,Nice product, and service is also good,Product is very good. Purity of water is excellent.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/71NXtZ0RVWL._SY88.jpg,Product and installation is excellent.must buy item at this range.,Value for money R.O. water dispenserSufficient capacity The pricing is good, using is very easy but the product is not too much worth to buy.,I have been using a similar coffee percolator for over 20 years now - and my old workhorse, a Chinese (Nova) is still capable. Since it was white, and therefore a very unappetising sight now, I needed a new one.Packaging: The design of packaging was perfect - stiff corrugated sandwich board box, foam profiled panels stuck on board for bottom and top, board wrapping around the glass kettle, the whole unit inside a thick ply cover. Frankly, this sort of packaging is more common in high end audio equipment. 5 * plus for the packaging design.Size: This is a small machine - and will make about 600 ml of coffee - sufficient for 2 mugs in one go. If you need a larger volume - look elsewhere.Body and finish: The plastic body is well made - the matte finish looks good. The bottom metal plate is seamless and black - will have to wait and see when spots appear. The kettle is good quality glass, and though no branding is present, feels thick enough to withstand minor washing bumps. The filter bucket and the holder with the flow control spring is OK - hopefully the spring and washer - which are fixed - will last. The lid moves smoothly and the hinges and the sprinkler also look sturdy. Switch is firm.Function: It worked very well on the first use. I had used an extra coffee filter paper on top of the nylon filter bucket. The flow was smooth. Coffee liquor starts weak, and then picks up strength. The drip stops well with the removal of the kettle - and though the manual cautiously states a 10 sec gap for drip stop, I did not find any leakage on longer removal.Overall: Very satisfied with my new coffee maker. Recommend buying.,Product doesn’t work within a month,Easy to use, and it turned out better than I expected it to be for the price.,Just Magnificent. Saves lot of time.,The plastic quality for this product is poor. It feels like a toy. I had bought a Amazon basics air fryer it had great build quality comparing to this Amazon basics product,If you try to find a replacement part it costs twice its value,its cheap and breakable. And the coffee is very very light,waste of coffee and also not a good flavour.,Nice product and simple to use no,There should be a fan speed control option.,Overall very good,Little noisy but expected,Fan is slightly noiseOperating switch is too hard for aged person,Best in market,Good product. easy to use.,Received 2 days ago, looks, color r good. Heating nice, 3 adjustments for heating 660W 1200W 2000W, whichever u requireNo auto cut or over-heat protection available Everything is fine about the product, light weight, good air blower and good heating, most important price is good,Best you can in this winter without doubt go for it,thanks Amazon for this heater,built quality as per description,haneul brand same as mentioned,Amazing product at amazing price, work as per the description, same brand received build quality is also superb, great for winter pocket freindly as compare to other brand, recommended,It is good product,Weight and heating process so easy and movable,Value for money and quality is also good.,I am not satisfied because product bilt quality poor and use that  on heter semll very iterating,High consumption electric It\\'s good  nd amazing product,Very nice product.

Good Pressure for superior cleaning. But Inlet pipe should have more length than it has.,Good pressure washer and easy to use , i think inlet pipe need to be more long other wise all good,Pressure is very good but mtr shows 115bar,Used this product for wash my roof as well as to wash my car.  Product is very good with low noise and good pressure. Recommend to have this product for personal use to wash your Car, Floor, Roof etc Purchased from Amazon for full price under no offers, still beat competitors by Rs.163Order was placed on Thursday 01/12/22, late in the evening at 11 pm.Was to be Delivered on Thursday 08/12/22 but arrived early on Monday 05/12/22 at 10 am.Quite satisfied with the Delivery, Packaging, Condition of the item and also Happy with the early arrival.Along with the Vacuum we received a basic Instruction Manual and Warranty Card.The Invoice was missing from the parcel, so it had to be downloaded from Amazon.To Register your Warranty, you require to scan the Bar Code on the Invoice and WhatsApp the details.Without any delay, excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was a fairly easy task, took approximately 10 minutes, which I guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etc.First impressions, the Vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise, but some attachments could be a little stronger. Especially, the extension pipes could be Stainless Steel same as the Drum and Telescopic in feature / operation. The main Vacuuming head attachment used for floor / hard surfaces could also be Stainless Steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite a bit, would extend its life.Its a 2 pin plug, instead of a 3 pin which could have been better with a surge protector fuse.The cord is of decent length, quite impressed with the quality of the cord. Also, the cord, which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit, after use can be rested on top of the Drum in a winding fashion, it kinda works and does keep in place without being a nuisance. Hose, same solution.The 2 side Latches are reasonably strong. Wheels are easy to install / insert and work fine.It would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored / latched to the main unit while not in use, storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regard.First demo was for the Vacuum.Noise average (not too loud or unbearable), reasonable with any other domestic Vacuum of similar power.Inside the lid, the dust bag clings on to its inlet, would be better if it could be secured / locked with a clip.In Vacuum (suction) mode the air gets forced out of the Blower outlet, this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level. Now imagine, if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces, it would be an unending job like a dog chasing its tail. If this outlet had a removable or having the ability to rotate something like a flap or adjustable Ac vents like in cars, then it could direct the blown out air upwards while Vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design sense.Suction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts, nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important.Then, follows the demo for the Blower.This feature should technically be equally as strong as the Vacuum, because the force of the air sucked in while Vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the Blower outlet. To make things interesting, there are fish gill like 2 vents on either sides of the Lid. These vents are the fixed kind, cannot be closed or opened. One of the vent very faintly can be felt taking-in air, while the other vent blows out air at a significant force. This particular phenomena I am bewildered with, cause as I understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the Blower outlet. So make of it what you will. Still does the job, if you\\'re looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours pet.Finally, the demo for the Wet.Performance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations, again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing, does the job which is important. May need to dry mop even after using the Wet function.In closingDefinitely do purchase it, use it often as required and also helps keeping fit,Do not allow dust to settle on your Vacuum Blower.Also ordered extra:i) American Micronic Replacement Dust Bag for AMI-VCD21-1600WDx & AMI-VCD15-1600WDxii) RODAK 35 MM Mattress and Upholstery Nozzle for Vacuum Cleaner Wet and Dry Cleaning, EU Import,It have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner, even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners. I bought this for my mother in-law. She likes it for being easy to use. It\\'s simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes, Extension pipes are little loose though. It\\'s easy to clean those cat hairs now. And don\\'t have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor, because it\\'s Wet and dry vaccum cleaner. Hope the customer care is a good one incase of any needs arise. They send me already opened package, but not used I think. They could have send us a fresh unopened perfectly sealed package. No complaints untill now. I liked the reusable dust cover feature, also it\\'s easy to connect it inside. Easy to handle, don\\'t have too much weight.It would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with a switch.,This is a domestic beast.... great suction.Only thing that should had been ther is speed control.Noise level is high, but with such suction is ok. As long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again, I am ok...Rest how it will stay with time will be something to see.,It is very easy to clean as the suction power is great 👍 very powerful machine indeed,I have been looking for a good vaccum cleaner for a long time now. I recently came across this and read the reviews etc. Some were good and some were bad. But at the same time I couldn\\'t find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners  in this price segment so I finally bought it.It came in a big Amazon box well packed and secured. Unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images. Here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible :\\u2060-\\u2060)• Very Good quality steel and plastic build💯• The suction(28kpa) is really really good even with the thick carpets etc💯• The wheels are really good too,They move effortlessly 💯• You get a lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and they\\'re good quality 💯• The blower function is really powerful 💯• The bag inside,which collects the dust & dirt is big and can be cleaned & Washed easily 💯• The noise level isn\\'t much. Its okay, Not loud💯• The cord length is 5mtrs which is enough 💯• The overheating protection is Good💯• All the Accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the base💯Cons:• The only thing that I think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes. They are good and fit well but if its a carpet or some other mats you\\'re cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again.🌟 Overall a 10/10 Product which fits all your needs,Wet and Dry [Cleaning of course;\\u2060) ].Better than any other Vaccum cleaners in under 10k price range . Go for it 💯( P.s I\\'ve tried some other Vaccum cleaners too which are in the 6k and above range but this is the all in one OP Vaccum Cleaner💯),Good suction with great built quality,Good durability,good suction power and quality product,Vacuum cleaner is very fine, suction power is quite good, drying power is also just OK,noise level is high as I expected. Cost is high as compared to other brands. Overall I rated it four star. Plastic is not of very good quality thought but it does the job well and it is easy to use.,,Nice product,I bought this product at a price of rs 335, at this price product is good, but don\\'t know how long will it work, as blades are quite low quality, plastic of the body is good, Cord length is also quite good.

The virtual installation and demo given by Manikandan was very helpful and made it easy to use.,Easy to use. Easy to clean. Easy to maintain. Good product. Value for money must recommend to everyone. Thanks a lot.,This airfryer as expected is an alternative for people who hate deep frying and oil less food.

Temp.  control is good. The indicator is brilliant. The cord is easy with the movement at the joint.,Everything is good Very happy with the product performance.Installation: Very easy to start using. Had to wait for 2 days for the technician but with the instructions from box, you can start yourself without waiting.In the box: 10 disposable mops, 1 washable mops, 2 side brushes, 1 main brush, Mopping plate, Deebot, Dust chamber with HEPA filter, Charging Dock, Cable, User Manual, Cleaning BrushCleaning performance: Superb cleaning with 4 power options - Quiet, Normal, Max and Max+. Lower suction means lower battery consumption. With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up (Good if you have children in the house). Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. In all the 4 power options, the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. The higher options are for deep cleaning. Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring, the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.Cleaning Pattern: 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a north-south or east-west cleaning pattern inside the edges. No specific patterns like Y or Spiral)Mopping Performance: The mopping also has electronically controlled water usage - Low, Medium, High, Ultra High. The app shows warnings when using High and Ultra High (The robot may slip due to water on the floor) but I have been using High water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such a problem. The wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings. The mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad (As it gets older, more area will touch the floor than a new mopping pad. For the 1st week, the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results.)Corner Cleaning: 1-2 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned, esp. if you don\\'t have straight walls (E.g. if you have a bathroom door, which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall, then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned). 90 degree wall corners may have a 1-2 cm area which is not cleaned, however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. All other areas with obstacles, such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned (Deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times).Corner Mopping: As the Deebot\\'s mop is round, it will not reach the corners, expect a 5-6 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. However on straight walls, the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 1-2 cms, which however will be cleaned by side brushes.IMPORTANT: If you have black furniture, Black stone / wall tiles, mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebot\\'s Top mounted laser is located, the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot. The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.Mapping: The 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. The N8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. Also, you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time (2 floors). The 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. After the 1st run, you can edit the rooms (Divide or merge areas) and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room, bed room, kitchen, etc.). Once the rooms are mapped, Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern)The created maps are not editable (you cannot move or adjust boundaries). You have option to add virtual boundaries (as a line or as a rectangle box) where the robot should not go. This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot. Deebot\\'s laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go (behind the mirror). So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them (if you have installed mopping plate, then Deebot will ignore carpet area). Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas (Similar to Virtual boundary).Application Use: I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. The app has an advanced mode, which works as per the stored map. If you turn it off, Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. E.g. I have a balcony which can\\'t be accessed by the Deebot directly. I can pickup and place it in the balcony, turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. Once it is done, it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.The app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. Area cleaning (Select a room or multiple rooms to clean), Auto clean (Clean the entire house), Custom Cleaning (Select an area on the map to clean).You can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room (or can use a common setting for the entire house). You can also preset how many times (Options are once or twice) you want to clean a specific room. You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. Deebot will start working automatically. However, this is not advisable if you are mopping. As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. If any water leaks onto the parts, it may void warranty.There is an option to auto boost suction on carpets (to Max+). You can set the option for continuous cleaning, i.e. whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. (Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area, resume the cleaning, and then return to recharge - this saves time)The app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories - Side Brush, Main Brush, HEPA Filter. This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images, which is really helpful.The app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. This helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.Cleaning and Maintenance: Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily, you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week (depending on the size of your house). Cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes - remove all hairs from side brush, main brush and wheels, remove the dust chamber, remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber, Wash the main and side brushes (if needed), Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth, Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. Also, remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. You will need to replace the accessories every 6-12 months based on the usage and maintenance. Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.Overall Rating: 9/10 The cleaning and mopping performance is very good, and better than a house maid in most circumstances. (E.g. Deebot goes under the sofas). Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle, and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot. In this price range, I am very satisfied with the performance., Quality very good, but 1 injection syringe must be add in this kit,It is an original product. Got it at a discounted price.  Everybody should consider it.,Genuine product from kent,Kent Gold, Optima, Gold+ Spare Kit is a very good product  , I purchase this product 2nd time .

It purifies the water and their is no impurities present in it. I have used other products but this is the best. The quality is also very good and durable . Highly recommended,I\\'m literally value for money & very easy to install everything written on the description box also it\\'s budget friendly .,Value for money and easy to install,This thing doesn’t hold on to the tap even if you use the attachments given. The screw cannot be tightened and as such it does not hold on to the tap.  Once the tap is opened it slips and falls away. A very cheap product and I am unable to return it now.,Filters well,Extremely poor quality with no manufacturer\\'s identity. Useless product. I advise everyone to not buy this product.,Don\\'t buy this product, don\\'t serve the purpose The heating capacity is zero .Moreover i have initiated return request. Noone has come to collect it,Best heater at this price. Quality is very good . Suggest everyone to purchase this heater.......... amazing product to buy... Good product to buy,Value for Money,Easy to use,Good product,Mixer grinder is good, easy to use and sound bit high. But all the jar lid is not good so cheap quality lid, it\\'s get removed top lid, plastic handle comes out from top, but overall is good and easy to use.,His cap system is not good,Good,Nice 👌👌👌👌 https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PfDZp8UzL._SY88.jpg,Easy to use,Items tap is not good for users,Very good 😊,Value for money, working fine,It is not suitable for my tap,I liked..so product good. So happy amazon.. Liked amazon products provided Sum like this, plastic material not good just ok,,Nice pedestal fan for havells company..,supplied without remote.,I cannot fit The Oscillating knob of of the fan , so the fan cannot be made steady. I am afraid that the inside fitting for this knob is broken or misfitted hence the problem.Please rectify the problem immediately, if unable to rectify, please give me replacement.,Fan safety grill clamp very low quality plastic,I\\'m impressed with this fan...,Good quality Nice product, low noise and good suction power in price range, received damaged packet and without hose pipe, but over all product is good worth of money,Received the product on time. Have used it once to clean and its easy to use , works well. The heating concern mentioned by prior reviewers is apt however don\\'t a damper for a purchase at this price. It\\'s a decent product in the affordable category. The floor attachment Particularly works very well. It is light weight and so cleaning lower end of ceiling fans was easy. The suction power when using sofa attachment is quite good in cleaning dust stuck in stitching corners. Overall, if you want to spend minimally and get all relevant attachments and your usage is for a 1 bed or a smaller sized apartment,  this product is a good start.,,Carpet bohot ache se clean nhi kar paata, baaki normal cleaning ache se kar deta he.,Got this vacuum cleaner after a lot of research and it has been a good choice till now. I wanted a handheld vacuum cleaner for both car and home cleaning purposes. My primary requirements were cleaning my car and gaming chairs/sofas. A car vacuum cleaner only wouldn\\'t have suited the purpose. Also, I wanted a power-plugged vacuum cleaner as the one with a battery can be used only for a certain amount of time, and there is a long charging period of wait.This product ticks all the requirements. It has a 5m power cable that is long enough to use comfortably. The suction power is good at 16kpa, unlike the 6kpa of most battery-powered cleaners. Noise is okay, I mean it isn\\'t so much to disturb someone until and unless someone is really allergic to noise.It has several components that helped clean my car and even my fabric gaming chair. And I was also able to see a visible difference in the window meshes.Yes, it gets heated after several minutes of usage, but I could use it with a wait of 2-3 minutes each time. Its weight is ample for horizontal and downwards usage. I haven\\'t used the stick provided, and I think it might be a little bit difficult to use it upwards on walls if I need to use it continuously for 10 minutes or more.I had to be sure that the accessories were available after purchase, such as the filter, which I was able to confirm with customer care. It\\'s a good buy. Let\\'s see in the long run.It\\'s made in China. The company provides 6 months of an extended warranty if a review is given and shared with them. This is a bit weird requirement to go ahead with. However, this isn\\'t a sponsored review and is based on hardly a month\\'s usage.Some photos are attached for help.,Nice product, but the filter strain was teared in one place, it needed to repair. But otherwise satisfactory. Build quality is very deplorable, they are just forcing the buyers to give 5 star by any means to give better service and warrenty assistance by a card inside the box, this seems really threatening. But overall working of this machine is somehow ok.I would rather suggest if you have options to not choose it, then go for that option.,Good for surface cleaning, build quality is not adequate but good to have at this price,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ix5q8WyWL._SY88.jpg Average products,This isn’t useful for smoothies. Good for lassi or cold coffee that too was leaking.,Nice for light fruits,Not continue works,,Overall good but can blend only softer food or fruits,I am using this Blender for 1 weeks and Now I must say it\\'s worth you money go for it I am college student and I usually make Oat+Banana MilkShake for breakfast which to my surprise it did really good job in blending themBattery: 1 full charge will give you 2 blendsBuild Quality: 4/5 really goodSo just don\\'t think it\\'s perfect for College students go for it,Product is not good it\\'s very very worest item banana also not griding atleast nd charging issues battery is completed 2min and it will stops automatically Hi viewers so I bought this product after watching the endless hauls of #amazonfinds. As much as I was excited for the use of the product, it did not prove to be as useful. The sealing side does not heat enough for a packet to be sealed well. The cutter side works fine. But mostly, the heating side has to be pressed upon so hard that the cell case opens up as it slides with the pressure of the thumb so I feel we can totally work without this product in our house. Its definitely stylish, comes with a Manual, Cells and a Hook to hang it but the slipping cell cover fails my convinience with it.,Gud,Easy to use, worth the money,When we press to seal lower part get open automatically,Not heating enamous power to heat and pack the plastic cover,Quality of the product is not good. The hold and press part for heating and sealing is not consistent. Sometimes it seals, sometimes it burns the plastic. Also, the seal comes off of right pressure is applied, so it is not reliable too.,The sealer quality is too good and it’s sealing well. The only thing is you hv to press it hard while sealing.takes only few seconds to seal an entire packet.  Good when you are travelling with a toddler and carrying lots of snack packets. Pocket friendly and cute,Average working Very good product..only thing I found lacking was quality of non stick should be little more better..good to use..,Nice but lock has little rust as shown in picture,Performs as expected.,Good product,It\\'s a light weight product.,good product.... toasts well... size also a little bigger comparatively to other products... happy with the purchase...,Product is non sticky but not upto the mark..,@Rs 99 this is great purchase from Amazon. After four unsuessful or failed purchase finally this item get delivered to me. Before this I ordered four different items not this one which were of very low price for one minute but after my order and payment the order get cancelled automatically on the very next day. But this time it get delivered. I am very satisfied. Like the product with decent look,Newely installed , now there is no issue,Batter than buying 15k 20k branded ro. Just use 3-4 yrs and buy a new one. Best 👍💯hai,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HN2ZnNzFL._SY88.jpg,Indication switch should be there after water is filtered,,Satisfactory performance,I have purchased this item 2 weeks ago. U have to call authorised technician to install the system as it is complex and cannot be fixed by local person. Also to check the TDS. the system work well although lots of waste water is been flushed out during the water purification I take it my food habits in three weeks. Better result.,LightGreat designeasy manouverabilityfast heatingwhat else can one want... absolute go for product!,Go for it,Good,Simple, light and easy to use ...best at its price,Temperature control pr5,its too light to handle and works good with this sole plate as dry iron,This iron box does the job. Its light weight and irons well. Very short wire to connect to my switch,Nice,,Very good product,Good,Turns on heat initially and then doesn’t heat up. Eventually needs to cool down completely to again start heating again. Wouldn’t recommend buying.,Excellent product pls buy.,Nice Very good product go for it and save for your money.,Nice product,Good and easy to use,Good work done with a whole family,Must buy ...genuinely I would recommend this for boiling eggs...it boils egg so fast and I wonder how does it peel so perfectly 🥰  just on love with this 😍,It really makes my work easy..also I don\\'t need vessels or cooker for boiling eggs...it also boils the egg so fast...love to recommend,It just boils in less then 10 minutes , every easy to use no need of much water and has an auto off option so don\\'t have to keep and an eye on itReally love this product,It\\'s a good product It gives hot water but only after 25 min of running which I feel a bit slow.  Let\\'s wait for years now to come up with it\\'s performance.,Good very good,I am already using 25 liter of the same geyser but no issues till date .,Good product, one con: very noisy like boiling water,Good product,This is my second purchase AO Smith geyser are amazing but sad to share that their Techician are very rude and never came for installation so I had to get it installed from my own electrical person..Please work on the technician part otherwise AO Smith geyser is quick .,Installments very easy,I have been using this Geyser for more than 2 months. It has been working great without any hiccups so far. It heats the water pretty fast. It stay in high rise and no issues due to high water pressure. I have never tried its temperature control feature, so no clue how it performs. I have set it at max temperature and it meets my requirements. Buyers may go ahead buying this without a seconds thought. https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gBvXGDt3L._SY88.jpg,Best fan with perfect performance,  great air with no voice .,As in picture looking same,2 months in using product. Good looking, dust resistant. Only issue I think of its heavy by normal fan standard. Fans are easy to install but no remote control. Price is little high i think for this it should be around 2300-2700 rupees.,Nice Product,Product is good but colour is dull if colour is light then look really nice,Overall good,Colour showing in app is not same in physical,Looks classy Device was sturdy and handy, suction power is quite strong all the attachments are good, except the extension pipe was so weak that it gets crumpled when it comes in contact with any object.,I bought this to get rid of dog hair on my bed and it does the job quite nicely. it gets rid of dust very easily. Very handy and durable product.,This is VERY strong, so while that is good for certain things, it can also be a little difficult to vacuum as the it sucks in the surface, making it difficult to glide along the surface.Also, it does heat quickly so you have to keep pausing.however, overall for this price, it\\'s quite an amazing buy.,A good product that cleans dust from upholstery and floors. Variety of attachments help for different surface cleaning. Good suction capacity. Long cord makes it more useful since you can reach greater distances from the plug point. Only reason for 4 stars overall is that when using it, some dust comes out from the collection compartment. The closing seal could be made more firm so that there is no air leakage out.,Easy to suction the spider nest on the wall and other corner dust.,Great product. Works great for the price it is coming for. As usual it is not a heavy duty vaccum so that means it is will get heated up... Give 5 mins break and use.,Affordable and easy to use, fits the purpose.,Good nice cozy machine easy to use and good looking The product is working fine. But at this price range there should be a temperature regulator. We are always using silicon spatula but the Teflon coating is coming off on its own. Product is functioning with in the described specifications,Compact,Good and reasonable easy to use,The machine is super easy to operate and use. 1000watt is hood enough and works fast as expected. Happy with the product.,Very good product all and every think is good only cord wire is very short so company have look,I like to all features and service from I bell customer care service I can reffer to another person for buy this brand,The product is good.Following cons according to meCord length could be longer.The toaster doesn’t closed fully. Which is something that should be mentioned in the product description,NA Good service,Good,I like this product,taste is also good 👍👍,Worth for money product.,Ok,I am updating my review, hope it will get published and the who\\'s and who of the brand will pay attention to it. After every two to three months the unit is having problem with the inlet system. Many a times, the inlet stops taking water but the indicator shows tank filling! It was rectified by the service person. Again, now the indicator showing tank filling while the inlet valve is shut! It should show the purple light means low or no pressure. It\\'s a faulty unit. The installation guy and the service persons were right who stated that the faulty and low quality units are sold online, whose statement I ignored thinking that every offline seller says so. Alas, I was wrong. I want this unit to be removed immediately and want my hard earned money back.,At this price this product is very suitable.,Esy to install I bought \"Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 4.5KW White/Blue\" and I\\'m really happy I made this decision.Let me start with why I went for \"Instant Geyser\" instead of \"Storage Geyser\".-Storage geyser\\'s have a tank to store water and heat it.-For example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water.-As it has to heat high volume (10 lts) of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes-Instant geyser\\'s on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes-However the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume(depending on tank capacity) of hot waterNow who should opt for \"Instant Geyser\" and who should opt for \"Storage Geyser\" is the question ?- If you like to have a \"Shower Bath\" for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for \"Storage Geyser\" since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses-Instead if we consider \"Instant Geyser\" of 3lts capacity for shower bath, it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water again-Hence for a shower bath better to go for \"Storage Geysers\"-If you like to have a \"Bathtub Bath\" then instant geyser\\'s are good to go because-Consider using a bathtub, a bathtub generally is of capacity 350lts-If you even use a \"Storage Geyser\" of high capacity as much as 25lts, still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes each-Because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 5-10mins for the next 25lts to heat-So to fill the entire bath tub, you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water = 350lts-So the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins (on an average) = 98mins-In this scenario of \"Bathtub bath\" its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you\\'ll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat/hotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for \"Bucket Bath\" ?-Both \"Storage geysers of 15lts or above\" and \"Instant geysers of 3lts or above\" are good to go-Just choose based on:  Price,  Time taken to heat ( instant takes less time ),  Energy consumption ( instant comsumes less )Now coming to \"Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 4.5KW\", why I bought this ?-Havells is a great brand-I wanted to have it for \"Bathtub Bath\"-4.5KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this product:-I have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds ( I have used a timer to note that )-The installation was totally free, however remember you will be charged if there is any \"Plumbing Work\" do be done.-No need to buy any extra accesories like pipes, everything is provided in the box, you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rs-As soon as the product was delivered by amazon, I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done, thanks a lot Havells ( This might differ for you based on your location, I live in hyderabad)-I really like havells customer service-The geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tank-It has \"Auto Cutoff\" feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off ( however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff, still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats )-It shows color indication: \"Blue when its heating\" and \"Orange when it has done heating\" ( Have a look at the pictures I have attached)Note:-Go for the 4.5kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds, the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of water-Make sure it is 4.5kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the \"Mustard\" colored geyser is not 4.5kw but 3kw ( better go for white and blue color to be sure ),Very nice product,Good product,4.5KW rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water. Good product,Great product at great price.,Value for money and instantly warm water comes in just 2min,Havella water heater,Water heats up in 45-60 secs depending on the weather.This review is after using this water heater continuously for 10-12 days in December, in Kolkata, with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at 14-15 degree Celsius (during afternoon/ early evening hours). On the coldest day so far, it took around 1min &10-15seconds to heat up completely.If you don\\'t have chronic pain, or arthritis, or this is not going to be used for very old people, whereby really hot water is required for bathing, I think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto 9-10 degrees, because I have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for a shower, not using a bucket, and it\\'s manageable.Obviously can\\'t be compared to steaming hot showers using a storage geyser, but this heats quite quickly, so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity.For that same reason, it can be used for multiple people, because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters, you\\'ll have fully hot water, only of lesser quantity, so if you don\\'t live someplace cold, or don\\'t need very hot water but mildly hot water, this can be used for multiple people as well.Installation support was also good.No cons, only that if Havells introduces a 5l instant heater in the 4.5kW range, then that would be a game changer and might give storage geysers a run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesn\\'t have their own home and might need to move around, because it\\'s compact, and provides instant hot water. Good product received and i give you this full review after 7days,Value for Money,Easy and handy to operate,I received my frother machine it\\'s good for price and the motor is also good works well have 3 different speed one can adjust as per requirement however I have received a different variant frother not as per images which is displayed but is working fine let\\'s see now how many days it survives easy to clean and it makes quick froth can also be used for eggs. I must say area of improvement would be selling details need to be update. Build quality area off improvement and the battery charging indicator as well should also show how much battery is remaining that feature is also missing, in the variant I received.Can purchase this product and can give it try for me it\\'s working doing the job.,I ordered black one but get a white. Build is not good as I think. Easy to clean.,It is indeed a good product the only thing that can be improved is speed adjustment buttons as it starts directly at the full speed you can reduce the speed but it should be in an increasing order (Speed Button),The power adjusting buttons are great.Froths in only two minutes. One charge can hold up to 12 times od frothing! Totally worth the price!!,I ordered this product for beating coffee, but this product is also best for mashing eggs, lassi making and other kitchen works also. Great battery life and rechargeable in short time period Good,Adequate and efficient are the most apt words. Its really of excellent quality , usage and VFM. I recommend it to all small families from one to five.Extremely functional, excellent quality, easy to maintain, clean. Takes little space. It doubles up as a momo maker, idly maker, OdiyaPithaa maker, Steamer and of course a Rice Maker.I have gifted three, bought three for my larger family by now. One for self, one for my parents, one for my village house. The earliest one is now five years old and is still cooking.Great product...Go for it.,,Only single rice bowl comes with this product,Good,Nice to use,,, go and buy it,Nice,Handsome looking rice cooker, especially the green color looks great, could have been tagged at 2500rs It is a nice product it does what as it says but the only thing is it does not have a great speed if you put a dura cell battery then Only it will show the speed and second thing is the frother my friend recieved from insta cuppa is another and what i recieved is another she has a thing or a button where you don\\'t have to keep pressing the button to froth but in my product i countinuesly have to press the button to froth,Indispensable tool for coffee lovers – specifically for making a professional tasting latte, cappuccino or espresso. It produces soft creamy foamy milk froth in a jiffy (Highly recommended to use full-cream milk for best results). It is handy, easy to use, lightweight, easy to clean with a convenient stand to park it when not in use. No hassle of wires or charging. Simply insert two AA batteries and you are good to go - best results with Duracell.Attractive and secure packaging. Express delivery. Very satisfied!,First hand experience with this product is quite good. It does the task with ease. Will use this product more than 1 month then will edit this review. But for now the product is simply amazing at this price range.,It was working well and suddenly after four months it stopped working. At first i thought I needed new batteries but even with new batteries it\\'s not working just in 4 months i haven\\'t even used it completely for 30 days in the 4 months I\\'ve had it.,Great product and easy to use, hoping I will not face any issues as mentioned in some comments.,Easy to use,The quality and speed of the product are just amazing...I thought it was costly but it\\'s worth the money.....blindly go with this..thank u so much,Product is good till now I have used it 3-4 times but still to use more and if anything goes wrong have to check their customer service.. Detailed review will give after 3 months of use The product does it’s job really well. Just feels a little heavy.,It is easy to use and wrinkle free and happy for using first time. Thank you Amazon.,Good product,First of all I really like the color of this iron. This is so cute to hold and use it. I was little worried about the performance but I tried this on daily basis for good 5 days so far and the cloths are really neat and wrinkle free. I feel this is little bulky as compared to the iron that I used from my friends in the past but otherwise this is a good travel iron. Now I don\\'t have to worry about ironing lots of cloths before travelling to somewhere.,2 level steam adjustment allows better control to obtain optimal results and Easy refill large 1.8 ltr water tank suitable for long steaming sessions and Powerful 2000watt all aluminium heating element for fast even heating and Double anti-dry design for comprehensive heat & damage protection, I\\'m really satisfied the product.,This steamer works like magic. I just used hanger for cloths and used it.Very useful for fast instant ironing.Need to press button for steam.All you need is little patience. Do it slowly.Wall on background helps.Don\\'t put hands on opposite sides of clothes, it\\'s temperate is high.,The results are evident. All your bulky clothes can be ironed pretty easily with this. A small amount of water is enough to iron a blazer or even a lehenga. The efforts have become minimal. It s a modern day treat to have this at your home. The price when compared to others is kept minimum. The warranty is pretty much handy extra six months,I used it for the first time in my life. And, wow, it just worked like any normal iron! It is handy, portable and fast enough to do the wrinkle free garments. Ok product 900/ma bast product A little family productNot resturant not hotel,No,Nice product,Good product,For Dry grinding of spices, motor heats up,👍,भाई कभी मत लेना नहीं तो पछतायो गे 6 महीना ईयूज किया हू और ये लोग वारंटी भी नहीं देते हैं कभी को कस्टमर नम्बर देगे कोई सुनता ही नहीं है बोलेंगे कंप्लेन दर्ज हो गया है और कोई सुनवाई नहीं हुई,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HMDwsW8bL._SY88.jpg In this price worth to go for,Yet to use it but looks quite classy and sturdy. Design is nice and base is detachable for easy cleaning.,Nice product, strong and finish, easy to use and clean, Like it,Good,The quality of the product is good and it\\'s very easy to use. Value for money.,Use it every day for mashing cooked vegetables to make soup. Easy to wash and store. Seems to be reliable.,Splashes and little power,This Amazon basic hand blender so easy to use and clean best of other compani blenders product so easy to clean easily use best of price in Amazon basic.🥰 Pros:1) Looking at the picture, I thought it would just be the blender with some cap to cover the blade. Turns out the \"cap\" was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality, has measurements on the side, and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when you\\'re using the blender.2) There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3) The blender itself is amazing to hold, looks great, and is pretty easy to use.4) The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically, you can leave it as it is.Cons:1) After over 15 seconds of continuous blending (that is, if I\\'m not just pulsing it but continuously blending), there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. I\\'m not sure if that\\'s a sign of overheating, or if it\\'s normal.2) There\\'s this groove right above the blade, and every time I\\'m done washing, there\\'s always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after I\\'m done washing, and I always have to go back to clean that. So that\\'s a small inconvenience.But it\\'s overall great, and I\\'d highly recommend getting this product!,Good,Making the life easy.,Great durability and original products,Very nice product for small or moderate usage.,Good product,Very good,Very useful product in day to day work Like,Loved the product alot. After cleaning off the lint, clothes looked good as new.,This lint remover is just too good...very easy to use and easy to clean...it removes the lint completely and gives a fresh look to the clothes.,Absolutely love the product, very useful. No gimmicks, I like it when the product does what it says. The brush at the back is just cherry, highly recommended. Blessing for winter clothing, it does work on any kind of cloth which has lint/fuzz on it,Super,Works well as designed. Cord free allows flexibility.But, the lint collector is a bit small requiring frequent emptying.Also, the collector could have been transparent to allow easy view.Nonetheless, this is a fine aid for day-to-day use.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/810x1MmF+9L._SY88.jpg,it is really very good product and easy to use and clean. I used it on my old winter clothes having lints and used them with confidence as it really improved the look Even my relatives used it when visited me and were happy to use it.. also . Bought it at 1199 in Dec\\'21.. Now at 899 is a very good price. It came with a charging cable and a cleaning brush. It\\'s very useful in winter when it gets cold and curd does not form properly. It maintains fixed temperature enabling fermentation process. I gave one star less because it does not have any handles so holding the apparatus can be tricky as it has this smooth surface so it might slip off from hands. You have to be very careful while holding and handling this curd maker, if they give side handles and auto-cut off feature then it would be best.,Package arrived in good condition. Now need to contact company for warranty,Good product to settle hassle free yogurt. Only thing is it should automatically cut of power once yogurt is ready. Else yogurt tastes amazing.,Got the product,looks good... checking now,I am writing this review after using the product for three weeks. I have chosen this as \\'Agaro\\' Brand seems to be more trustworthy and has 1.5 years warranty (1 year +6 months extra after registering)Good Things - It works as expected. For my taste and local weather conditions, it takes nearly 6 hours. This will vary based on individual taste and local weather conditions. Very light weight. Cleaning is easy and there is no problem even if there is a bit of spill.Not So Good Things - Quantity is not 1.2 liters, it is few ml more than 1 liter.Plastic covers are delicate and there is chance of them getting damaged while cleaning. In my opinion manufacturer should have a provided a optional spare set of covers.Considering the cost, build quality is sufficient (as it is Made in China)Length of the wire is 94cms and usually requires an extension,Good product,Good product,It\\'s just amazing. This sentence is enough to comment for this unique thing.I never ever had ever imagined to make yogurt in quick time and even in winter without any compromise in taste. It\\'s a nice product, does the needful. Was easy to assemble and it\\'s technology is really getting the juice from the fruits or vegetables properly and there is very less waste.,Easy to make any kind of juice, just love it.,Product is good,The juice from this Juicer is so tasty and natural,Good product,Good product,Nice product,Juicing very easy ,Good quality,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61mgjONWNTL._SY88.jpg its light weight easy to use but is not worth for the value,Very good product,Good,Very good quality,Easy to to use,,Good and very happy with this product,Value for money @600₹,Easy to use Suction power mentioned no where on product spec or packaging. But surprisingly it\\'s having good suction do most of the cleaning effortlessly.I purchase 3ltr version which having button to control suction.It\\'s some what true that suction reduced when dust cylinder is somewhat full. But I resolved issue by emptying dust cylinder and cleaning filters.It\\'s somewhat tricky to remove cylinder itself for cleaning do it carefully ow u will break plastic locks.It\\'s very similar to midea vaccum cleaner available in uk with 16kpa.All extension pipes are of steel make is it difficult to work with due to weight.Btw it don\\'t have blower function.The price of product and performance make it best buy vacuum.,It\\'s worth for the price given,and does it\\'s job perfectly,only concern(on my personal experience) I had was the extension cord provided is made of steel and it\\'s bit heavy and we can\\'t hold it for long while  cleaning the spider webs in roofs, rest all good,Suction power is okayish. Its a good product, value for money but can do much better with a good suction power. It doesn’t remove most of the dust takes too much effort,It is a good choice if you are looking for a vacuum cleaner under 5k. It is worth for the price.,nice product worth the money,Suction power is good, cord length sufficient for home purpose, noise level is also low right now,Please go for it. It has excellent suction power easy to carry around and has different options for cleaning things. Good product for this price,Very usefull and comparatively very good when compared with costly vaccum cleaners in 8k. Dust cup is just awesome..Only drawback is no blowing out...... Awesome,I am purchase July month 2022. Product was repaired. I informed to customer service. He assigned Technic. Said this product was replaced with 10days. But still issue was resolved. Again call with customer care.  He said not in our control. We asain one more time,Good,The rod is good overall, the only drawback it has is missing power Indicator,rest it looks fine,Use this it\\'s worth,The heating rod heats 5litre water with in 5 to 10 minutes The product totally worth its value,excellent and perfect,रड की लंबाई के अनुसार पानी ज्यादा डालना पड़ता है इस कारण गर्म पानी होने में टाइम लगता हैं Overall heater is good but it\\'s size is small but it can make small area heat within few seconds,,Power Cord length ..very very short, and Function Knobs have no Written Marking of the Functions.,Material used is not of a good quality. No after sell service available at my location.,This room heater is portable and quiet efficient. It warms my room perfectly. It was really a good deal.,It is very useful and easy to handle,Sufficient heat is blowing with air, very nice product in this price, best to use for single person in office and home also not making noise like other products.,I like it It\\'s been just a week ... So yet to know the performance overall but till date it\\'s working fine,Good,Good quality,Battery capacity is very poor of power,Product is fine but I was disappointed by seeing Made in china lable on Png version. Also seller sent LPG model first instead of PNG so check your model once received. Product is working fine.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SxpCSn4PL._SY88.jpg,,Product seems to be working fine till now but Very Very poor service by Bajaj Serviceman.He came and just hanged the geyser on wall and said his work was limited to that only.We had to call another technician on our own to complete the installation, and do the plumbing work.Even pipes, cells did not come with the geyser and were sold by Bajaj serviceman separately.0 marks to Bajaj for service. Good iron, loved the cordless way of using it. Instant heating, with steam flow for crisp ironing.,Good iron box. Steam is as advertised. Irons well. A notch above swivel chord when it comes to cordless convenience. 100ml measuring cup was cracked as it is delivered. Hence a star less,It is good and easy to use, go for it,For First time users, steam ironing can be useful and may love this variant. I have used Siemens iron already and it\\'s not working so on emergency ordered this model from this brand. Both brands are varying in specific parameters. Bodywise BD iron box is small in size. So it took little extra time in closing a single apparel iron. Weight also lighter. Steam consumes water very quickly like I used 100ml twice for 3 apparels.. Color variation observed from image on box and original product inside. Finally work wise okay and job done. This experience is from single use of BD box and first impression. Have to see and watch rest of the story if any,Absolutely portable and easy to reach corners. Steam ironing make easy to iron cotton cloths,But not so heavy,Good product enjoying using it,This iron is good for daily use and easy storage Beat with hand blander,Its decent performance,Thik h,Good product,Speed 1 and speed 2 was not working, it starts from speed 3. So returned.,Good and value for money,Not good as per price,Fast delivery. Received on 30.11.22. small & elegant hand mixer with friendly power to beat the coffee, dough, etc. use twice only, too early to respond but still feel, inalsa brand will maintain its repo, overall like this value for money. 2 rods can not be switched seperately, selecting 1 rod always switches on the top rod.,, Can buy it,its really a good product for the price,Ok,Very good,Product is nice. I used it for idli dosa barter.Kindly suggest what to do?,The device is good but very loud!,The jar is damaged.,Ok good.. Has only one blade in jar and the jar quality is very bad.,After using for one month, it stopped working and amazon customer care is asking to reach out pegion customer care but, i have been calling several numbers from past week no one\\'s responding, no customer service don\\'t buy,I got two medium jars instead of the large jar.,After the 1 month of use.I gifted this to my mother from my first income, till now she dosen\\'t complain anything about this mixer.Don\\'t know about other costumers, but mine product working fine, yeah its true that it makes noise loud but the performance under this price range will cover up the noise.,Good product go for it,Nice,Overall meets d purpose In budgetSound of motor is regularGrinder missing 4 blade inside d jar (all jars wer given wit 2blades only)Feedbak aftr using for 4months,product have too much scratches on top Perfect for winter,MEETS ALL MY REQUIREMENT,Good but expensive product with working process,Since I have tried Bajaj 13 fins oil heater, this 11 fin heater is not worth it. The quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as Bajaj.Although I am comparing it with Bajaj 13 fins still the room size was 12x10ft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to a comfortable temperature. With Bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even 2 hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable.The fan placement is low and it doesn\\'t converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings.Please check both physically if possible, Bajaj is on a heavier side and fins are of good quality.Though I received 2 defective Bajaj heater ( physical dent on body) from cloudtail , I have again ordered the same. Hope this time it turns out to be good.No company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product. Good luck.,I have used bajaj oil filled heater before. This feels more sturdy. I think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish. Although it’s a simple assembly but still I wanted to buy a good brand as it draws a lot of power and I was concerned about safety.It makes the room warm quickly. Based on the power mode you choose. It will make the room dry. I have seen people using  water vaporiser alongside but on low power I haven’t felt too try in 1-2 hours of use.Overall, since it was borosil, I expected an even more beautiful look but since it works well I am happy. Easily 1.5-2 k costlier than its peers.,Using 3rd Party off-brand blowers for years, I finally took the leap and bought the 13 fin Volcano from Borosil. It has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiency.Packaging:The item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original Borosil Packaging.Assembly:Using the provided guidebook was easy to understand. The unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy. Then all was left was to plug it in.Usage:The heater warmed up the 20ftx20ft room with relative ease. It has 3 power levels for the fan attached and a temperature regulator. The heater takes 5-6 minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperature.Looks:The product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your room.Additionally, the two-year warranty and the safety features make it a must-buy product for winters.9/10 would buy again,Did not give the expected result,Ordered this OFR a month ago and have had used it since then. It is a powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly. Although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room. It is quite and doesn\\'t even vibrate. I already own an OTG and an egg boiler and now the OFR. Borosil has stood up to the mark providing good quality appliances at a decent price tag. I have been using this Geyser for almost two months. it heats up the water in just 15 minutes and quite power efficient. Uses almost half a unit for two person. And if you leave it on for the whole day its around 1 unit. Very power efficient. And looks stylish in the bathroom and due to the form factor doest take much space. Go for it . You get all the pipes and Installation material in the box so no need to buy them separately which is the case in some other models.,I had 2 option while purchasing this geyser, Havells vs this one. I opted this one as this was cheaper then its Havell\\'s counterpart but this geyser does not satisfies me at all. The only PROS is its heats up water very quickly but rest is all CONS.I keep the know to maximum temperature but still the light does not move from orange to red even if I put on the geyser for 3 hrs. It does not holds hot water for long. I have used Recold, AO Smith even Amica earlier they were not as quick as Crompton but they used to hold hot water for long. I have another Havells at home whose light goes from green to orange to red to display water temperature.,Paisa wasul hai,The product is not that good , just given 5 star energy efficient, but it takes more time to heat the water, also don’t holds hot water for atleast 6 hrs. Temperature control also not so good , after getting 2-3 liters itself , water becomes cold, even if it is on from 20 min,I’m using ao smith geyser in our one room from five years, no issue, again purchased 2 geysers for other two rooms , one is ao smith and other is this crompton, even though i spend more for this geyser I’m not satisfied. Better go for ao smith or racold..,,Waranty card are missing.,एक होम गीजर में जो होना चाहिए वो सब कुछ है सबसे अच्छी बात है पावर आफ होने के बाद भी गीजर के टेंक में बचा पानी 8 घंटे तक भी गर्म रहता है।,Good product using since 2 months working properly My only concern is longevity, so let\\'s see how long this one lasts. Otherwise, it\\'s quite quite useful, especially during winters.,Good looking but light weight. Not easy to clean.,Nice product,I bought this as it is made in india. It is light weight which is good and does its job well. The lid must be manually opened and must be pushed all the way up to hold. Initially it fell back but it needs to be push back to hold upright position.Am happy with itafter using it for two days.,Except for the cord length of the kettle which should be a bit more.Otherwise, THANK YOU FOR A GOOD PRODUCT.,Very nice,Good working,Heats well, less noisy and looks elegant. Cord is short and partially opening lid makes it difficult to clean. Has worked well so far. Good product and superb fast heating.As it was small tank if u need to get bucket water1. On geyser and wait till water gets heated (2-3mins) ON TAP and fill bucket with hot water.2. OFF TAP and wait for another round of water heating then again fill bucket and leave the tap ON untill bucket filled with warm water.3. If u need more hot water repeat steps 1 &2.Cons:-1. One need to purchase inlet & outlet pipes which costs around 400 as this was not provided by orient.Writing review after 20+ days usuage.,Heater is so slow as compare to Bajaj heater ... currently i purchased this 1 but it\\'s not good,I have ordered two of them . Installed in bathroom as well . There is a trick to use it in bathroom. Either turn tap really slowly or by turning on tap at full sppeed. Whenever the the water get cold again switch of the tap , after 3 to 5 minutes again on and fill. Just this compromise you have to make in place of storage geysers.,Product body fitting is average. Be prepared to spend another 600-700 R\\'s. on installation pipes, 16A plug and installation charges. No installation plate with geyser. To be mounted on screws. No safety valve supplied with geyser. Overall average product. Better go for Havells which comes with all accessories.,Easy to install.Temprature controller is not available with this product..Till date working good.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/51IzGNDZ7eL._SY88.jpg,Ordered on 7th feb 2021. Received as per delivery date. On opening found that the unit is wrapped with plastic and found water droplets. Maybe they tested the product before delivery. Coming to the product, it heats water to boiling temp in 3-4 minutes and you can expect 4 jugs of hot water only.Delivery:5/5Packing:1/5 — since no bubble wrap or anything to protect the product.Product:3/5— you should not design a product with such low capacity, now I am struck after buyingLooks:5/5Will update more later...,First of all this is not a storage geyser. this is instant water heater. So better to understand the feature before using it. Just switch it on and wait for 1-2 min. it will start supplying hot water . As i told this is not a Storage geyser like 5-25 Ltr.  It comes with 3lts capacity only with 3KVA. So once the set temperature reach . Then Open the Hot water TAP in normal/Slow running speed .So that it will continue supplying Hot water/ warm water. If the Hot water Tap will be fully opened with full speed then this instant water water will not get sufficient time to warm the water. Hope this review will be helpful. Good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41D5G0vX76L._SY88.jpg,Worth for the price,Compact and lightweight,Nice,Nice product easy to use, price also good,Nice,Chenagidye Good quality,Super 👌,Worth for the money but the knob is slippery,Good product,Nice,Ok,Little bit of noice,Good Im really satisfied with this geyser im using this geyser for all my home purpose,I give to it average rating.Not bad but Good.,Energy efficient,value for money,Product is good and experience has been good.,After installation of geyser for 15ltrs. We are facing the voltage issue which occurred couple of times and was repaired instantly. Can anyone help me to fix this issue permanently regarding voltage issue due to Geyser,Technician has charged for connection pipes. He told  - connection pipes won\\'t come with this 10L model,Energy efficient and easy to install. Attains max temp in about 25 mins from room temp. Value for money.Post purchase service is very good.Electrician from the Company installed it very next day upon delivery.,Installation very fast. Very nice,Efficiency is good , cost is little more compared to it\\'s competitors.,Product quality is good but after sales support from LG local services center are grossly disappointing, don\\'t misread into the installation charges. You will be in for a surprise with discrepancies on installation charges. Please ensure you check with LG installation service team before hand.,,Product is good and no issues with Cooling or any other functionality.The installation was expensive, Amazon installation says 1199 + Tax, but the total installation cost is 1199 + Tax + Stand Cost +  others = 2651.Also, the copper wire was missing and the LG installation person told that I need to contact Amazon and they will reimburse, I called Amazon customer care and they said they will reimburse upto 3000, the wire costed me some 3300.Amazon reimbursement is in form of Amazon Pay balance, so I actually ended up paying CASH as below to the LG installationInstallation Cost - 2651Wire Cost - 3300Total - 5951Amazon should look into why copper wires are missing from packages, it seems  to be a regular issue as installation guys were aware of it even before opening the package, it is un-necessary issue and headache for customer buying from amazon.,Good,Noisy at full speed fan mode, but quiet enough at medium to low fan speed.Cooling is good and features are more than enough for normal use. Room temperature display is useful. Remote is good enough.Overall, no complains.,Everything is good and fine. I love it. Though I bought a pack of two, after seeing the pictures and checking model, I received only one compatible with my Aquasure, the other is different and not compatible with my unit. So essentially my money for the other is wasted because the return window was over.,Using product regularly,Easy to install.,Poor quality, doesn\\'t stay more than 1 month, it\\'s kinda duplicate.it is available in 300 rs in CSD but, it\\'s not available there. That\\'s why we choose to buy it online.but, it\\'s duplicate and very expensive. Hence,Not satisfied.give the address where we can buy it offline/online also what\\'s the warranty of this product (mention it).,Good,It\\'s easy to use.,Installation is difficult if you don\\'t or can\\'t understand the fitting procedure, but once you do, A-Okay, and super easy.IMPORTANT :  Lasts me well over 3 months, but i recommend changing it after you think the flow of water has slowed down a lot, OR you think the water tastes funny.For the last few days of its life, the water will not be completely pure, and it won\\'t completely stop.This filter has a good water flow rate, for a family of four, it disperses enough water, fast, within 30 minutes you\\'ll have several liters of water to drink.Also, the main thing about this is it is CHEMICAL FREE! - it also filters out VIRUSES! (take a look at WHO recommendation. If you fold a cloth ten times over, and pour water over it, it can filter out cholera virus)I would recommend this to all home owners. Since i got this cartridge delivery, i didn\\'t need to run to the store.,Really liked the product..... But amazon packing is really made me disappointed... Really broken a trust on Amazon..... Filter kits were completely separated from the box cause the external box was too small and made the filter kits squeeze completely... I just pulled the filter kits to get it\\'s normal size.... Please amazon don\\'t do this kind of weird packing.. Atleast pack in a approximate box not this kind of flat huge box...... Thank you It is broken and it is not useful. Please change this product,product is so so... the plastic quality is not so good as per the price.it claims that it can be stuck in the metallic areas like fridge but the magnet is not working.,The first one was not working and the replacement was sent without box with a used piece. The battery had water while I received it and even the delivery person was shocked,This is marvellous product to use . Such a small product but does wonders . And that too given 2 batteries,Great product and lovely packaging,I don\\'t like it the product it not working,Not satisfied, Small and compact. Literally the size of your hand.Heated up two cups of water to 75c (hot coffee temperature) in a few minutes.Great for the avid backpacker,Not the best but ok with price. It is small so it only takes less space. Looks good.,It takes repeated auto swich of and on sessions to cook Maggie.,Actually I purchased it for travelling purpose at least I can get warm water and I can make black coffee at any place at any time...This purpose getting solve  ... But It is not usable to boil Eggs and other purpose like Cooker rice etc.,U cannot cook r boil current consumption will be high,Good one product,बहुत ही अच्छा है। मैं तीन टाइम खाना बनाता हूं। सब कुछ अच्छी तरीके से बनता है।,Top stand should be included in the item The one I got with the mixer grinder lasted only for 8-9 months, hence I had to buy a new one.Grinds well though.,Quality is very good, i must recommend it for sujata mixer grinder. Go for it if you want chutney jar, as its a best one.,Worked seamlessly with our Sujata mixex (Powermatic, and Dynamix). Note, all these have same Sujata machine, but different combination of attachments.Our original dynamix jar was without safety locks.This one has better design. Taller, and locks, so prevents spilling.A very good buy, indeed, for us.,Original and Good,It’s super product in every aspect 👍,Its a genuine product you can ho for it 👍🏻,Outstanding product,Original Sujata jar. ,after 15 days uts 2 tubes not working...waste of money,Fuse early,The item is nice, light weight and good to use. The only issue is crude finish. The grill is coming off from sides. The reflector surface is bulging out and appears that it may break with heat. I requested for replacement but e mail sent to me says you will refund me the money after receiving the item . This was not the arrangement. Kindly replace the item with one which is free of defects. In cold conditions of hills in Uttarakhand I would like to use this item. Kindly give your views on my point so that I am prepared to receive defect free item from you and I return this one.,Sleek body and the Colour and only product of three rods with two year Warranty Light weight too and beautiful stand and can be rotated,Very good option in this range . Working efficiently and giving good temperature to  my room . One of my friend using this product for last 5 years without any problem. Good point is that it does not gives any smell as other blower gives.one suggestion - increase power cord length  by  9 inches so that we can use any where.,Item broken after some time  .. customer care not picking the phone even a single call,Was very useful in the record breaking winters this year.You have up to 3 levels of heating this is the best part. The only thing is that the light gets too bright so as to hurt your eyes but this is the issue with all such heater. Thought it would be enough to warm 2 room and passage but it\\'s heating fan is so small even 10*10 room heating took 3 hours to warm. They have BTC but it doesn\\'t help to warm quickly,,It is a good product and this month I bought 3 pieces. The last one looked like a used and refurbished heater. The wheels provided with the heater are old and worn out. They do not rotate smoothly and there is difficulty in moving the heater.,A quality product which will keep you warm :),Not heating well. It works but radiation of heat is very low. I have other radiator heaters like Havells, Venus which hear comparatively much more for same power consumption. Will not recommend purchasing this. Surprised from this brand as kenstar is usually a good brand.,Used for 1 season. Good quality. The only issue was humidity in room on long usage >4-5 hours continued power on.,Liked, very good in operating, easy to use,Not getting heat,kept 1hr but no luck, waste this.. I installed it myself in my kitchen and it is very useful.,Good,,Heating of water good. But water become so hot u can\\'t put your hand in it , if it mixes the cold or running water with the hot water it will be good. Or water temperature can be adjusted it will be great.,The product is very good. Easy to install and easy to use. The water spray jet is also good with movebale outlet.Water comes out, either hot (60 degree centigrade) or cold (same like your water tank temperature).I thought, I will getting mixed water, as there is no provision of controlling the temperature , always the water is more hot that you even cannot put your hand, and if you bring the knob towards cold, it immediately cools down, so it is either hot or cold, not both.Even if you slightly move the knob towards the hot side, within 3 sec the temperature rises to 60degree centigrade from 30degree centigrade.Was expecting a reostat to control the temperature.Not able to use for the required purpose for kitchen.,Pls do not purchase this items. water does not get hot at all. you reduce or increase water pressure. It\\'s biggest weakness that there is no option to increase the temperature Or last one its price totally worth less.,Wonderful product in this segment and value added product for home during winter,The water gets extremely hot when given in hot mode and quickly gets cold when cold water option is switched.Ideal should be: like geyser, it should have the option for both hot and cold water running parallelly so that a nice warm water flows and things get done.One cannot wash dishes with hand when water is very hot or very cold It’s easy to use and amazing product by amazonThank you !,Waffles came out nice & crisp. The product did a great job. Rather than spending high bucks on Branded ones like Borosil or Prestige, I would recommend this Waffle machine. It\\'s value for money. For Single Waffle Maker, this is Best.,The product is worth buying if you like making waffles in the breakfast or give a new texture to the sandwiches you make.,It\\'s become a daily part of our kitchen, it\\'s cute, easy to use and clean. Can make a range of waffles, sweet or savoury. I like to cook each waffle twice till it\\'s more crispy. Absolutely go for it. Makes a great gift too!,Convenient,Not giving it 5 stars as there was no measuring cup as promised. Otherwise I successfully made a very cute  yummy  waffle.,Been on my bucket list for a long time. After seeing Shivesh video, kinda promotion actually. I decided to buy for my daughter on her b\\'day. Very easy to use n to clean as well. But takes time to bake but maybe that\\'s how it is with any waffle maker. I don\\'t know. But for beginners, it\\'s a good buy.,very good however size is small Best performance, I buy it twice...Really best for medium room...,Without power plug deliveredNever expected.,It\\'s small and body is also poor quality,,Damig,durability,The product is durable and value of Money.It\\'s very good product in this range.The quality is good and the air blow output is best. I like it,It\\'s a good investment to always be accurate about the grams in your purchase. But it\\'s comparative small in size, so it\\'s not good for ambitious individuals.,Good accuracy, but if someone wants more higher accuracy eg. 5,6,10,15 grams, this product might not work for them,Nice,Ek bharosemand aur nice product. ..,Good,Nice,Easy useLight weightComes up with battery Thik hai,Recommend for you,Riturn my product it is broken,I like the product but the wire is too small,Metal used is too thin in thickness as it was dented while delivered and same was rectified with bare hands.Cord was also smaller in length. But overall in this price range not much expected.,Very nice,So far so good. It gets a bit overheated I hope the base does not melt or get over heated. Have only used it once when the performance was extremely satisfying. Will have to wait and see,,Product was good, and value for money It\\'s been 15 days of using this product. Heating is quick. Though it caters only half of the bucket ( that\\'s expected in 3 L) . Quick delivery. I read the reviews earlier. So i opted for local electrician to install. I had the accessories of previous geyser, saved my money.Only issue I am facing is indicator. There are two lights, red light is not glowing since the purchase. What is with that, I am confused. Apart from that it\\'s good to go for a family of 3-4 even in winters.,It\\'s very useful for Getting the Hot water instantly it\\'s very comfortable,Water becomes  hot in no time.,Perfect best gyser, don\\'t know about energy saving  bec.install just now but performance wise best.,Good one for regular use. Energy consumption found little more . Good option among instant geyser.,Liked,Product and performance is very good,Working fine from last 1 month, flow pressure is low so not able to use shower, i need to install pressure motor for shower using. Within 30 second hot water come. This product of yours company is heating 5 liters of water in 15-20 minutes, it\\'s wastage both electricity and money.,Very Bad Quality of wire, and Rod.,The product is just ok, but the quality is a bit low, but you can\\'t expect a premium at this cost.,Very faster,Gud,Nice,Nice,Cord length is too small 1. The steel quality could have been better, but it is adequate.2. The second major problem is that neither the upper nor lower container has a handle, and so when you try to open them after 15 minutes, they are still hot, making it difficult for children to operate it.3. The flavour depends on the coffee you use. We use genuine South Indian chennai-made coffee bean powder, so the aroma is fantastic, but that has nothing to do with this particular product because any authentic filter coffee will have the best aroma.4. I can return the product very easily, but for such small cost product that doing so would put the supplier in loss due to the cost of the return courier, so even though it would be difficult to use without a handle, I won\\'t & rather buy some better one.,Good quality. Easy to use and wash. 369/- is bit expensive for 250ml capacity. 290-325 rs. Available with same graded steel. Very good & detailed literature with the product. Tx.,My husband used it, he can cook much well, it was easy for him,Good product,Good product to buy if you are far from Southern states.Quality seems to be good till now.No unusual stains or withering of enamel.Filtering action is consistent with design.,I got rusted piece. Material quality is just upto the mark. Worth it if the price is under Rs.200. Size is enough for 1 or 2 cups of coffee.,Very thin steel has been used to make this.,Excellent The quality of coffee maker is excellent a DM very ease on making coffee and getting served hot.,The silver color is much better compared to stainless steel finish. Lov my coffee made in this! This should be advertised as suited for 4 cups not 6.,Does the job well and even after placing directly on the stove there is no discolouration. Steel quality is upto mark.,I have been using this product for a while and have no complaints. Makes amazing filter coffee.,Looks and quality are at par with other brands in its price bracket. In function, this kind of a mokapot design is flawed at the cleaning aspect, including this particular model, in my observation. In it, the pressured boiling water pushes through the coffee powder in bulk together, thus rendering the flavour inferior to what is brewed otherwise when the water percolates little by little. Secondly, the portafilter type coffee powder container, positioned just above the boiler chamber, sends some dissolved coffee back to the boiler water through the upward pressure pipe, rendering the entire remainder water mixed with coffee go waste. Thirdly, the coffee powder container\\'s gasketted mesh is sedimented too while filtering the forced brew upward. So, when a person like me thinks of preparing a brew in a mokapot like mechanism, the very thought of the predicament of dismantling the the tiered chambers, separating the gasket, and then wash the pot thoroughly, because coffee is lurking everywhere therein to cause unhygienic residues, dampens my desire to go for it. I am no debater if the idea is to leave the pot just rinsed and washed and not rid it of the residues. All this is not the case with the downward filteration method of the other types of coffee machines that are absolutely unmessy. No offense meant for any system, this is my personal opinion.,I like the convenience of making coffee for 2-3 people in one go.Its very easy to clean it up after every use. Its rust free and looks beautiful while kept on kitchen counter even idly,Like and good product,Ordered this for my stay in India.  it worked the way it should be, it has silicone washers, easy cleaning.  Product quality can be improved.  OK product.  not WOW! 👍,Good quality. Easy to use.,nice,Value for money,Value of money,Good filter, I\\'m using for Kent RO,It\\'s an excellent product at this price. I used to call the RO service guy for changing the SF. RO guys charged ne 250/- for candle and 250/- for service charge. So in total i was paying 500/- for changing the SF. This Konvio SF i got at 125/- per piece and i got SF changing tool from local market. Now in 1/4 th of price, I am abke to change the filter by myself and most importantly the outcome is same. The quality of water is same as before so no downgrade of water quality. I really recommend this product.,Product quality is good, and easy to install Nice iorn in this price every one should take this,The product is good as usual.

I was not aware of the process that you can\\'t have it like the normal coffee so I tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds won\\'t get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it. Then I went online to understand the process where I came to know about this coffee maker. I bought it for 2cup coffee which cost me 299/-. You can get bigger one also for 4 or 6 cup. You can go through the process of how to make south Indian filter coffee online. To me it does job very efficiently and finally I am able to have a good cup of filter coffee. Now about the product it\\'s not premium quality steel but it\\'s a decent one and it\\'s very easy to use. You fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night. So to me it\\'s a value for money if you want to try filter coffee.,The press doesn\\'t work perfectly but does the job. Size is small, you can only make one cup.,The steel quality is world class. Gives a proper filteration Original part costs 4 times more as per service guy. Worked without issues on pureit classic g2. The snap pin connectors need to be manually pried open (use a safety pin and YouTube) I used the AC power cord sis as-is because the pureit part had a resistor fuse or something placed before adaper and i wasn\\'t sure how this part would work with it. Connected directly to plug and joined the  24v connector,With the money...

The temperature doesn\\'t remains constant not we can set it at a particular temp.2. The water flow is very restricted and takes more than 30 mins to fill the bucket of 15L completelyWhere as the geyser we used earlier ( bought from a local shop) could be set at a particular temp as we can adjust in stove. And the water flow was also comparatively more faster than this.,This instant electric water tap is awesome. This tap working properly by this seller. Packaging is awame and complete with user manual also. I liked it. Must purchase the product from this seller.,Very good product as expected,Lack of mannual temp control.,,Loved it. Fine quality, Na,గ్యారంటీ,Good use for getting instant heat water.I have used it for last 9 months it was still good and no issues.,Very bad product don\\'t bye used product i received,If you don\\'t have hot water line installation in kitchen. This is the best solution. It took 30 min max in installation. Best for winter use. Not for bathroom use.

Length depends on distance.2 pipe clamps is neededReview: you can buy it , it is working satisfactory. But other similar products are selling it with pipe, clamps etc. So please check first. I like build quality.,Easy to use but voltage consumption 3 kw it\\'s. Too much,Average,Good product Excellent and useful product, easy to use. Water quality is superb. Only issue being, how will we know if the cartridge needs to be replaced. Where from can we get these? Presently ordering 1 more filter!,# Easy to use.# Buid quality could be improved.# Water helped whole family to get rid of gas and acidity issues. Eventually weight loss.# No difference in taste.# Worth trying.# Frequent change of filter is on down side, eventually it helps as all water filter does.,Water spills when filling glass. Like taste of water,Must have extra filter cartridge ,must include ph value indicator,top lids securing is not good,must be close more firmly to avoid leakage,container jar material needs improvement as it got scratches very easily while cleaning inside, but overall it is a good product as per use and design,hope kent will improve on the above points,PH level that defines alkaline in water is not up tu mark . Need to be m verified as company claims it turn water into alkaline anything above PH 7 but in reality it’s hardly good as any RO water 💦.,Must buy product…Portable..sturdy & a very useful tool to have…it raises pH level of water actually…..I have experienced wonderful results in my stomach related issues….Must buy….!!,,Useful. Water is alkaline definitely. But after installation,  6 to 8 washes are needed before drinking Best mixer as compared to flimsy  350w,750w.

Awesome product.,Best sellers,Product ok no bill receive no extra screw not receive light red and green same time working suddenly heat working okay very well,The product is Portable Instant Heater and all of the 25000+ reviews are of Magnetic Spoon. Amazon team should check for this issue.,Best one usefulin weather season value of money 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 This neat, lightweight device responds without delay. No waiting with the button pressed and counting seconds before a figure is displayed! A single tap is all it takes to change measurements, start up, or switch off. This sleek beauty can weigh something as light as 2gm, provided the substance is placed directly on the plate. Great, if accuracy and speed are what you need.,Good product,Good one , got on a affordable price . Quality is good , definitely would help for planning luggages for overseas travel.,Nice cute scale ...looks good in kitchen . Does it\\'s job perfectly,Amazing product with perfect and accurate weights.,I had seen an Amazon brand kitchen weighing scale and every time I was about to order, it was out of stock and now that I found this I did no hesitate and ordered it for 749/-. I am sure if I had waited for some sale period I wud have got it for 500/- but didn’t want to take a chance.As I’ve checked the scale the following things are good1. Accuracy2. Tare function3. Light weight4. Ease to use5. Large backlit display6. Stainless steel baseWhat cud have been better1. A hook or a hole to hang it on the wall2. The weighing platform is slightly elevated from the base and possibly debris / rubble can stay in between where it’s slightly difficult to clean with cloth ( will have to use some kind of small brush).Overall my recommendation is to blindly go for it and is really worth the price. Durability is yet to proven which only time / aging can prove.Thanks Amazon and Seller,Dont go for 300 or 400rs product., If u gonna use it for long run (more than 6month)., This is the best product to buy.,It works fine., Light weight., And accurate.,300rs product might show you incorrect reading like +/-10gm and doesnt last more than 1-2month.,,IT IS WORKING WELL. GOOD PRODUCT. The blower functionality is good. the brush nozzle is not good, it breaks on sharp corners. overall its worth buying for small cleaning.,A very premium look and feel product. works well, I use it to clean my laptops and other electronics.,I really like this portable wireless vaccum cleaner. I\\'m using it for cleaning my car. It comes with charging cable, user manual and multiple cleaning brushes. Charging capacity is awesome. Suction power is very good. Easily catch dust particles inside car. It is best value for money. Thank you Amazon.,This is probably the most portable and useful vacuum cleaner that I have come across. Compact and portable, it’s cordless and hassle free. Great suction power and it is so convenient to use. It’s vacuum and blower both. Its is easy to clean so it requires no maintenance.,It is exactly what I needed, a sturdy, simple, small, and smart vacuum machine. It has great suction power. Wish it had little bit bigger storage box.,,Blower leaks air and if it to be used efficiently,vacuum cleaning: averagethey should have designed it like a tunnel.Use it as vacuum cleaner, remove the filter and accessories to be used a blower in reverse.,I really like our portable cordless vacuum clener. It\\'s handy, lightweight, and easy to use. It\\'s great for quick clean-ups and does a good job on our cars, floors etc. I had it for a few weeks now and it\\'s still going strong. * Easy and quick heating* Price 1099 is best in class* 1 year + 6 month additional warranty on.  registered device is very good in class* best product for those who uses occasionally (10-15 times in year ) because it will last for years if use is limitedOverall very good product,Is better automatic but heating temparature is not good manual is good,Product works best and quick just its quite light weight,Overall the sandwich maker is good. The length of the power cord is not sufficient.,Easy to prepare sandwiches of any thick.,It is a very good product. Decent cord length. The grill marks on my sandwiches and panini come out excellent. Value for money is good, considering I bought this for INR 999, it\\'s totally worth the spent. You can make one sandwich / panini at a time, but I only cook for myself so, I don\\'t find any issue with that. But again, it depends on the size of the sandwich. Go for it.,Very Nice product, ideal for small kitchen needs.. Very Light weight.. 1000w power capacity get heated very quickly... I say only one drawback powercord length is really very small, it should be longer atleast 1.5 metre to 2 metre would be ideal... Otherwise its a great product...,the best thing I like about this is the facility of big sandwich maker in a small size. There is no other company offering this design in this size. very good. thanx Very small it is, hardly for less than 6 heavy clothes.Very good for single person but not for family .,Too small for home use good for travel,Value for money,I like the product.value for money,Nice product..,I\\'m happy with the product as it\\'s highly portable due to its folding ability into its pouch and its sturdy enough to stand on its own but size is smaller than i expected.,Material is not good, for these price you can buy any bag...,One of the bag is damaged, but overall product is good. The only issue is that the built quality is very poor. It broke on 2nd use. Rest the adhesion is good.,The product is not sturdy, the handle broke after a weekThe adhesive is working, but it is too diffuct to peel the tape,Product is okay but the stick is very delicate so it broke, now it very difficult to use the product.,The handle of the product broke when I used it second time so it\\'s very poor quality would not recommend.,Its value for money,Easy to use,Product of good use. Wish the Handle of the roller was easy  to use,We have a beagle dog so we have extensive use of lint rollers in the household. Have been using the 3M, but its very expensive if you consume 4to 5 rollers every month. So thought of trying this one as i though how bad can a lint roller be. The stickiness of the glue paper was good enough to remove the dog hair, but the quality of the handle is really bad. It did not even last 2 days. So ended up using a wooden stick or long pencils for the job. If the makers had spent some more on making a good handle even if the cost would have been Rs 25 higher, then it could have been a great product especially for those households which have pets as they need it more frequently. So i might go back to buying the 3M product of look for something in between. हम संतुष्ट है हम जादा से जादा श्रीखंड बनाने काम आता है कभी कभी केक, आईस्क्रीम बनाते है।,Nice product and easy to use 👍,Sometimes gets heated when used for longer,Bakwas,Like this product,Good product , value for money,Good product on this price,Good Product Only one pump works and the other one stopped working. Waste of money!,Good 👍,Not value for money, material is very weak. For same cost you will get 4 bottles in the local stores,Product is good, worth for money and easy to use,Does not give a fine mist but a stream of small droplets. I believe it\\'s good if you want something in this range,Good quality. Fine mist spray.,Good, little pricey...,The spray function is good, but bottles are not quality product. Very thin will break very quickly Easy to make milkshakes and diet smoothies..Useful.,Very good quality 😌,,This product is very helpfull amd backup is good,The mixer was split throughout the blender.,Easy to clean, portable, easy to carry and easy to use or traveling..,Good for travelling, Good,Don\\'t wait to juice your fruits from Sujata. This variant is powerful and effortless. Just that it is delicate to calibrate the juicer to the motor,Sumit juicer mixer grinder is a very powerful and useful machine for my daily use.,Best quality,I LIKED SO MUCH,Actually very tough machine. Made life much easier.Cleaning the juicer sieve is little tough but then that\\'s true with all machines.,A good purchase for entire home purpose. But juicer assembly is not much easy I thought.,The juicer is good for every day use.Only thing, the noise of the juicer is too high... 🔸Everything is nice,including design & function,works as intended and mostly as description.🔹But here are things that couldimproved.🔹the upper lid should be able to open up a bit more to the back if we want to wash it more thoroughly since having lid not open in a way that it goes  a bit back enough for the lid to not feel a bit in the way its not as comfortable as it could be (this shouldnt become a point which should make ppl avoid buying it though since many other models seem to open up till the same angle as this one does unless you found one that opens up more than this one, if you already bought it or still want to buy it you can use a big bottle brush to scrub it even tho your hand can go in but you ll feel like you have to be more careful while Washing to not accidentally hit the lid (you can see from my image/product image)🔹rest of the body seems sturdy but the handle feels a bit lighter than the body so it makes me wonder if handle would fall off due to daily strain when i pick up the kettle by handle alone (may be it wont break/come off but i hold the kettle with both hands on both ends just in case to be safe) : these are two things i d like to be improved if agaro makes any changes in the model features in future.I didnt return it though because chances are other models are the same or similar and apart from all that it works well.. So yeah.,Very good kettle and big in size,Cord length is good,It is very robust in temperature control. That is to say on and off manual and automatic off. Regarding cord, it is 1500 watts kettle which is on the top of ordinary Indian domestic non power 6A plug. They have given one meter quality wire  with 6A plug.  This means if your home wiring can stand 1500 watts on ordinary non power plug you can use it in any socket anywhere. (The switch in the kettle is bit wobbly, not sure whether it is purposely designed so: initially I was not pleased, now love it because of majestic performance),Product looks good. Value for money.,seems good until now... hope will last long... good purchase 👌,Kettle is nice 👍 and cord length is also good but package 📦 is not good,at the time of delivery it was opened, I gifted it to my mother last month; it was like love at first sip! easy to use, easy to clean, easy to flex, a blessing for any Indian adult! Still new to french press coffee, so I used South Indian filter coffee for the past few weeks and could instantly feel the difference between a cup of freshly pressed coffee and one of instant coffee, although I have been advised to try grinding my own beans for optimum enjoyment. I seep my grounds for around 3-4 minutes after heating the press for around a minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heat-resistant the glass is, I would however still advise taking precautions. The markings inside also provide a great measurement of how many cups I would end up making. Not only have i used it for making coffee, but also to froth milk and to make tea. Attaching photos of a coffee i made using this french press with a layer of frothed milk. Ngl, one of the favorite purchases my family made, am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyone.,Time saving coffee/filter.,Been using this for many months now and it\\'s great. Love that it has line measurements. Only thing is I wish the top surface had an arrow-type bump on the plastic to point where the holes are you so you don\\'t have to look down but you can just tell by touch.,Delivery: Amazon delivery is always reliable and it didn’t fail me this time too..Packaging: Both outer packing and the product packaging were intact. Product packing had the right information and was very usefulProduct: Very compact. We used several coffee makers in the market, but all required electricity to run. We wanted to have a non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements. Just add the coffee powder and hot water. After a while when we press the central pipe, coffee comes out. The nozzle makes it convenient to pour it a cup.For this price in great India sale, I think it’s worth. I am inclined to give 5 star, but reserving 1 star now. Will use it for a month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies me.,Good one for a Black coffee lover,Very very happy with Cafe JEI\\'s French Press. It has become an important part of my daily ritual now in past 10 days. Easy to use and maintain and would recommend buying without hesitation.,Instruction manual could have been a hard copy..too much steps to get the ebook,Got this French Press last year and another one few days back! One for Coffee & another for Green / Black Tea.Totally value for money. The built is solid and filtration is on point!Super happy!! Purchased this last month. It\\'s good as working fine for me. Size is bit small but you can easily toast 2 normal breads at one go. Just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side. Cord is bit small but it\\'s good if you have plug near your kitchen. At first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear. Cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you can\\'t wash directly under tap. You need to use clean cloth with wetted with water. You can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth. Apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grill.,Overall good.,It is Ok but does not look sturdy enough.The top and lower heaters are not parallel if the sandwich is a little thick.A little better design would have avoided this problem,Makes the breads go crunchy from soft. 10/10 would recommend.,Very nice easy to use except there is no temperature control knob . I like my sandwich more crisper,Quality is good and easy to use , received in 24 hours,Product is Good i post review after 4 months from purchaseSufficient for 3 to 4 family memberI suggest go it,easy to use and easy to clean.not bad at all.2 issues:1. the hook is on one side so if your sandwich is a bit bulky, then the upper half may be tilted and loose on one side.2. the hook is also flimsy so there is a risk of breaking. The 6ltr storage is not at all sufficient for a single person. Water cools down very quickly,It\\'s doesn\\'t have temperature control knob,Like,Value for money,Easy to use,Good water heating,This review is only after 2 months of use. Build quality is good no extra noise, and very minimal in look.,It\\'s value for money Easy to use, easy to clean, there is no timer or power button to set timer or to on and off the toaster. Its a good product otherwise.,Yes , Sandwich 🥪,Quality is not so good. The finishing is also not proper. First I got product where lot of scratches were there on the insulating plates and finishing was bad.Later, Got the replacement but still the finishing was vague.Product is also very light which is good but not sure about the build quality inside.Make sure you read the replacement and return thing. Else you may end up having this product even if you wish to return.Overall ok ok product,When auto close system doesn\\'t work than there is no use of this product. Please do the needful and next time whenever you send it please check the product. Otherwise you will loose your dignity.,Like the toster,Good must buy,Good,Nice product We have used this product so far for boiling potatoes on the top lid using the steam coming from bottom container. Potatoes were boiled properly. What we liked most about this product - Easy to use, adjust temperature.,,Worth for price.. It\\'s two layered. The outer Black looks shiny and inside steel is bit delicate but over all its good product.. 2L and it\\'s auto off feature is working perfect.,Detail review after 3 months of usage..,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61m2bYnXcFL._SY88.jpg,Looks stylish in appearance; 2 litre capacity at such a low price is excellent; other brands have high price at this rate. Only thing that hurts is, the cord length is too low. Need to make certain arrangements for this reason. Overall...BEST AT REASONABLE PRICE,Good quality,The product is good ...At first we receive a faulty product but amazon changes it ....Kudos to Amazon...The product is nice ...has multiple attachement...Good product especially good for Bachelors कुछ खाश नही है मगर ठीक है कोई ज्यादा खराब भी नही है,This protect is good but very too much  noiceJuicer it too good,Purchased few days ago. The plastic quality is not as expected. I think It is not for long lasting purpose. Operating functions are good to use.,Item is good but in my case motor started sparking with in 3 months, still replacement of motor is pending from maharaja,Not bad,,Yes the product is very useful and serve the purpose for what it is.,Valuable one  cost effective and amazing delivery in one day. I like the price where it comes and the features it offers, but one thing I din\\'t like is its plastic fan can cover .The quality of the plastic used to give protection is very light due to which it can break easily , so we have to carefully lift the product. The cost cutting is done in plastic build.over all the Product is fine.,concern for inlet pipe folds hampering the water flow & foam container too small so contains half water & half froth. Must do something for this considering 2022 customers.,The product is working fine as expected, and the pressure is also good for in house cleaning purposes. Like two bikes and two carsRecommend product 👍.The inlet pipe(blue color) quality is not up to the mark.And also reset button is missing on the product I received, but later I contacted the customer care and found out that I received an updated version and it doesn\\'t need reset button.,The warranty period of 6months is too short for such an item.,High noise and machine heating to high,Only Bucket filter  are missing..Please  send me the bucket filter only immediately.I don\\'t  wont to return as soon as possible send me bucket  filter  only.. I like this machine.Send Me reply.Thnk u,Everyone shd have it ... it\\'s not only to clean your or any vehicle. even you can clean washroom, flooring in minutes.,Good product best under 5k Ok ok,Quick heat and auto cut.,Average,A very good product. Easy to handle. Easy to clean. Can bill water as week as milk. Cord is little short.,Steel quality is very good. you can buy,,Quality item,I think that the thin plastic lid may get broken someday. You can\\'t open the lid single-handedly and it isn\\'t easy to clean it due to its designer shape on the inside. Also, I think the base coating will also fade soon. Normally after a few months of usage, you can see the area of coil heating directly when water boils. In my case, I can see that just a few days after purchase.Overall, I wanted a 1L kettle with a big lid. So my major purpose was fulfilled. It is just that I find it of low quality than expected. ,You can buy it.. it’s worth,Overall good till now.ease to use,This humidifier\\'s got a 4.5l capacity. Filling it once gives me around 3 nights full of cool vapour at around 50% setting.No complaints in using it for a week.  Auto-cutoff works are advertised.  Usage is fairly simple and straightforward.  Noiseless operation.A very minor observation:Tank is filled upside down and water is vapourised by a transducer in the bottom unit.  This is fine, but there\\'s no mechanism to hold the tank and bottom unit together, tank stands atop the bottom unit just like that. If you\\'ve little kids who\\'ll topple the tank this can be a concern.,After filling water full at night by morning it is stopped mist and water is overflow and item is damaged one don\\'t know whom to contact no warranty number issued to claim warranty, customer care they said service ppl will call back \"still no response almost a month over, think before buying this product.,Good and easy to use and setup agaro ultrasonic humidier. Im writing review for warranty extension. Model glory. Nice size,Bought this to increase humidity in the room and have been doing so !,fine mist good throw. not tested sleep quality Average product,As per use its costly,This product is only for lint. It is not effective to remove pet hair from clothes,The roll has different layers , I don\\'t know what to do after this roll layers completed,Useful but would have preferred more adhesive power...Got at cheap price in sale,It removed all dust and threads get stuck on my clothes after wash,This is the best product.  When I was ordering this I was confused about quality because it was chep in price. But once I have used the same it\\'s wonderful. Work fast because of bigger in size. Highly recommend.,Bad product. Product is of no use. Overall Rating - 4.5Decent quality.Fairly accurate measurementsCommon cup and spoon volumes covered.All conveniently hooked onto a ring from which they are easily detachable.Feedback:a) Quality could be improved. Finishing was very rough with edges not curved / file smooth.b) Could provide graduations inside the cupsc) Could provide ML value on spoonsBig Miss:The Tablespoon one is marked as teaspoon :),Good product,Nice item. Good set. Easy to use. Quite sturdy. Very accurate.Just that the scoops are quite large overall, due to the long handles.Hence difficult to store inside containers.,That’s a nice utensil to have in kitchen. It gives a right measure of everything when baking,The material is made of plastic,Broken on first use,Quality was good and easy to use,Being low cost, good I have been listening about Sujata mixer grinder since I was a young kid and this time we decided to upgrade to Sujata again. This mixer grinder is amazing and still the best when it comes to other similar in this segment.We are happy with our purchase and the mixer grinder is working amazing so far.

Nice product,Go for it.Best mixer at this price,noisy,Bhut badhiya quality hai . Easy to use, easy to wash. Best grinder quality,Speedy mixer with good quality of output,Out station now,Certain pros and cons: Noise is there, of course its  a 750W motor…its not a silent mixie…the jars will lock and get jammed in the groove…all the jars same issue…then we need some rubber grip to twist it hard in the reverse direction to get unlocked…this is what I faced….otherwise, grinding is very much okay and doing fine…,This product is good. I am using it for a month now. Grinding is good. Noise level is bit high but OK as it does the work. White color In outer face of mixy is a drawback. I purchased for high rate 3250Due to Diwali offer rate has been reduced to 2750. I think it\\'s good product. Entire product including the beating machine nd other pair of dough hooker is absolutely perfect but the important pair of steel beater is really poor in quality..a rusty pair of beater \\'ve been delivered nd that\\'s too very disappointing... I rather doubt whether they are made of actual steel or not. I would have really appreciate if the quality of beaters can be improved coz the entire product other than this justifies it\\'s value,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/616OTkp1OnL._SY88.jpg,Nice product for making cake cream....I have used this product more than 8 months.....no issue...no complaint.....good working,It\\'s good if used properly.,I like this product.,its such a good product by Kent. best part is that after buying i got a call from Kent and they took full review about the product.,very good product , go for it .,easy and nice, good usage.....

The major issues I faced was not able to get the technician from the brand. Later with the help of Amazon got the technician to install it and the service was good.,Product is good. Except for the outer material quality is bad, very lame plastic.  Service and installation is good. Water tastes good for copper initially,  will let you know after 30 days.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71k14usIFyL._SY88.jpg,This one can purify water upto 30-40 litre per hour only if your water has tds below 500.(my water supply -borewell & municipal supply)The water tastes preety decent and light(maybe due to extraction of minerals through multiple filtration). Better than the one water you get in the water supplier for 5 rs coin.If your water tds is above 600,than the machine starts to malfunction.By malfunction i mean, their will be weird thumping sound like some stone got stuck inside the water purifier.The other problem you may find is less water purification (maybe less than 2 litte per hour) and the water taste like cough syrup.,Nice,little bit of noise while running,Worst product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/51+mfKzPloL._SY88.jpg ,Not much durable,cannot close proper,Great for storage. The product is as advertised.,Both sides of the bin tend to bulge out when clothes are inside. Hence, the lid might often slip inside the bin. The both sides need some support to keep it sturdy so that the lid stays in it place.,the material is flimsy and cardboard is not strong.. the side latch or handle stitched is not the strong. A box can\\'t hold the weight when its full. Cheap price cheap value.,Appears to be very weak,may get damaged with in a few days of usage.Hence returned it.,Too early to question its durability. However, it looks sturdy. It is bit different from the product image as you can see in my pictures the entire top isn’t designed as projected, that’s a bummer. Good for small families only.,Good product. It was Good.ok with the price.,It depends on the dough you prepare.with little practice we can make pluffy rotis.Only thing is we cannot touch the steel part of the roti maker while preparing rotis.the steel part gets heated up.so we have to carefully deal with it without touching the steel part.Other concern is,it is 8 inches only.for making alu parathas like that if the size was bigger than it like 9.5 inches like that then it was more easy to make  stuffed parathas,It\\'s worth to have roti maker with you . Cooks fast rotis and all depends on practice .I cooked methi parathes too and we\\'re good . I found parathes was much good in roti maker.i am lazy it\\'s me and my husband here for two persons rotis making I found its much easy . It should have in each kitchen.. if you have atta maker also than making rotis are not much hurdle . For roti maker dough must be soft and atta maker makes soft dough too so must have both than your rotis will be good.,I like the product,For one person it was hard to make dough,  pressing and cooking. Now by this chapati maker everything become easy,Extremely good value formoney, clear instructions, and easy to use.,Good for making parathas more than rotis..,It\\'s an excellent product. Kids and males can also easily use it. Really the best value for money. Don\\'t even think for any other brands. Just go for for Libra Chapati Maker. Truly, Gathering guests is no more tension. Nice,Don\\'t buy this item. If you pierce egg it will outflow through the hole you made. And if you don\\'t pierce the egg it bursts. Whenever you go for boiling of eggs, you ll lose your eggs,like,Its good and multipurpose , but only drawback is difficult cleaning, if you make anything apart from boiling eggs,Made in india and most useful product i suggest try this one sure you satisfied,We you have a small family for 2-3 person than this product is for you,It\\'s having non-removable heating plate which is difficult to clean if used for omlet.,The model was received with a broken power plug pin, making it not usable, all together. This model only has return with replacement (No Refund) so I have placed my replacement request. Let\\'s see what the experience would be - watch this space for update..UPDATE - The return was successfully completed and a new piece was delivered as replacement. The new item is working fine. The whole return and replacement took a week. I\\'m satisfied with the whole experience.The item, however, is not capable of doing anything other than boiling or scrambling / poaching eggs but the cleaning after scrambling / poaching eggs is very cumbersome and hence it is best if not used for these purposes. For me it is only suitable for half-boiled eggs. The material of bigger measuring cups is a bit thin so feels like cheaper quality. The material of the smaller measuring spoons is thick and good quality. The edges of the handles for the cup sizing are way too sharp. If you are into regular cooking of variety items, go for it.,good to buy,I bake cakes for that needed measurements This gave cheaper price with good quality,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/81I4ZPQBWPL._SY88.jpg,Satisfied with my purchase.,Good,No brainer.. good product for the purpose involved,It is good for price atleast not plastickIts steel Work perfectly and amazingly.Must buy for cloth lint,It is so convenient....

I likeit,Looks like quality has been considered well in all respects!!!!,After around 3weeksOne cutter got jam so i don\\'t know how to claim warranty everything here look cheap.Take on your own risk,Easy to use, reasonable cost, looks good, makes less noise, jars are light weight. One should buy it,nice product,Nice,,Good product,any one can buy Got it with intact packaging open it up the motor and jars were shining, We have been using this mixer for few months and it works wonders. I have been using the dry grinder jar for grinding turmeric, rice for my 6 month old and chutney jar for different types of chutney. We have used many other brands mixer but never had this powerful smooth working one. U should go for it.,Mixer and pots\\' quality are good but chuteney jar is of big size hence not good for small daily masala grinding. Should have provided small jar or option to select.,Good,Very good product, efficient working.,Working very well without giving any problem,👍,Excellent product!,This is such a big name in my family, and it holds the name true. Well packed, and really good finish. Very happy. The iron had water still inside it, the plastic clips were half opened and the box looked like it was opened , the Amazon box was intact . Just that product box was taped up . Expected to get a new product and not a renewed item .If I knew I was buying a renewed item I wouldn’t have paid full price .,Good product,The product is good but not for steam iron. Water dripping outside of the iron box wetting the cloth.,This product is easy to use as no problem of wire and works fine and take more time remove wrinkles,1) 1380W is not enough for cordless design ( Quickly looses heat while usage & takes time to re heat - you often end up waiting for the unit to get reheated ! - Corded Design is better for 1000W range models.2) Though this Has continuous steam option -  this drastically reduces the usable time and once you return the unit to base - excessive water dripping issues can be noted. Condensed water flows down the base to the table !!!3) User manual does not cover all necessary details.Overall - this is NOT a well designed product. &  Not happy with Real life usage,nice product,temperature drops down very fast,Socket of the holding station seems loose. Sometime need to press down hard on the holding station. My review of using new Vacuum Mop Pro 2 for 3 days...1. The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They don\\'t mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup, for the app and robot  to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. Mopping is average. I would call it \"light wiping\" and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum + Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So it\\'s important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats (main door or bathroom mats). It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we don\\'t even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.Pros.* Battery life* Suction power* Noise levels* VacuumingCons* Mopping is average. It\\'s at best can be called as light wiping.* Setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing.* Once the device is confused it doesn\\'t correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset.* Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.,ProsFor cleaning dust it is very good .we can set daily schedule.even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule ...cleaning the box after its work is also not  very hectic..brushes are providing..We can set restricted areas.ConesMost of the hairs n threads are stuck through the round main brush.. little difficult to clear the brush.It has been more than 1 year iam using this.One time the movement is low .when ichecked..so many hairs are stucked in its wheel.it was little  difficult to clear the hair strands.Mopping it is average only..only takes very little amount of water.so oily things will remain in the floor..once or twice  in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol..It can\\'t reach the sharp corners also.Once we create restricted area..by the time of using it couldn\\'t detect the proper area we marked..so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times.it is main thing I hate about this product..remaining things are okay....then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again..it is bit annoyingOverall it is very good for me...my brooming is almost completely replaced by this ...once in week I do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didn\\'t covered by this machine ..,In all other aspect like, price, battery,app feature, suction and cleaning its really very good product.I find it very useful and nice to have product.So will directly make note of  some drawbacks/improvent area, i observed.1) Sometimes it gets confused or leaves a specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle.2) Its little noisy or I will say not a silent thing in standard suction power, though that with any vaccuum cleaner.3) Xiaomi could have provides extra Hepa filter with it.4) vaccum+mop doesn\\'t clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush, so I do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option.5) Charging is super slow, if compared with any 5200mAh battery with mobile fast charger, its ~10 times slower despite such, a big docking charger.,I am a bachelor and i do not like Maid coming to my house.this solves the purpose. It is great at vacuuming my 2000 Sqft house. It can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life. was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life. It collects way more dust than the manual brooming.It can skip corners and narrow places. Once in a while i just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on.5/5 for navigation and room mapping.Mopping is equally bad. Mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails. it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor. Also water tank broke in just few cleanings.Recommended for vacuuming purpose.,Very good product. Very helpful product in my home.,We purchased the product in April and now it is not working.After charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped,Easy to use and Working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable.,Helping hand. More reliable than maids. Does the job well. Once in 4 days you need to mop yourself. Good suction power. A reasonably good product,,A bit costly for me,,Using since 1 year . No problem faced.sound is normal.,The shape does not fit where i want to get it installed. I want the round one. Can i get it exchanged or returned please?,Easy to use,Good product but the speed is a bit low. Hence less suction power. Very low noise. Really happy that I chose this for my Mom. Made her life quite easier. We r a large family of 8 & have used it only for kneading flour. It does the work its intended for,Very much helpful product easy to handle good to go for,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rjfYCs0qL._SY88.jpg,Nice product👌,I m using this stand mixer for making cakes. It\\'s great .,Used for making dough, it went well and it was quick one. May be due to its planetary motion, it\\'s making sound than expected.,Very sturdy,Dough maker Good quality fan. Finish and colour was good. They even gave a safety metal rope for added safety.,Wind size improve,,Good fan from bugget,No Ani dast,,I am not satisfied this product,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-wl+rlQPL._SY88.jpg received a product yet to use and give further review however quality is nice. Instructions are clear and easy to understand.,Everything is fine but the power chord is too short, only 50-60 cm length. No flexibility in the use of the machine in the kitchen or other place. Check if the power wirelength is sufficient for your use before you order.,Awesome waffles are prepared, should go for this,Very nice product. Easy to make waffles. Easy to use . Worthit to buy.,Amazing product worth each penny ! At the cost of 5 waffle one can get life time anytime waffle!super easy to make waffle.Be careful for outer plastic body ,very fragile !,I made waffles for the first time. To make it crunchy ensure you don\\'t fill in too much batter and also keep it for a little longer even after the light turns green. Keep an eye on it till u get a dark color of waffle [ensure it doesn\\'t burn ;) ]. Good for household use. Easy to clean. Wire is a too short but it\\'s manageable for me so I gave it 5 stars as it is as per my expectations.,The waffle iron does not heat enough to make the waffles in the time indicated by either the light or the cooking time on the recipe. Tried it for the first time today. Let’s see if it lasts.,Very good, Easy, Good quality,Waffle maker in the market available, Very affordable price, Great deal If you are not looking for a expensive product this is a good choice for you.Decent size.Looks decent not great (You know what you are paying :) )I would recommend this product.,The product is good.Delivery made in a beautiful way- nice packaging,Good one but should be handled with care. It\\'s so light and weight. For less clothes it can be used,Handles not stitched well.,Super product........❤️good thickness...,It ok,Good sturdiness , durable and good buy for the money..,It\\'s a so so product. Not so sturdy and durable.Not also free standing sometimeLittle bit expensive.Storing capacity is good I m using  this for my personal  room,Nice product for winter season,Good product and price,This device is febulous.,The handy heater is good for student.I brought specially for study I am happy,I am using for my room and giving proper heat but takes time to increase overall room temperature.  value for money portable heater can be used anywhere.,It is handy easy to carry good heater no extra wire directly fit into the socket.,I loved this product. It\\'s smaller in size, portable, easy to use and most importantly doesn\\'t consume much power. Product is OK, but huge noise irritatate use the product,Liked the blower function and also the suction is strong however the machine is too loud and the extensions could have been longer.,The noise level is too much hope they made a device with noise level low,Reviewing after 3 weeks of use. Bought for cleaning purpose in my small garments unit. Cleans the dust very effectively. Easy to use & move. Paper bag inside to collect the dust & other particles is not good enough. Wil tore easily. But can use the VC without it. Performance wise its a good product.,,Suction is by far the best I have seen among all Vacuum Cleaners. Blower is however average.  Over all no doubt one of the best vacuum cleaners available in this price range.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QUzG+l+qL._SY88.jpg,This is my genuine rating.  Whole thing is good. If you want you can buy more accessories according to our use.  Sound is a bot high, but it\\'s how this works with high suction power. It got it\\'s own space for keeping accessories  that\\'s cool Nice purchase, Really liked it..,Really easy to use and clean. Have made multiple items of fries, chicken nuggets and chicken drumsticks, veg samosas and they have all come out really well. The best part- no oil!! So it\\'s really healthy. The digital touch screen options are precise and it even allows you to change settings seamlessly.It\\'s easy to use and clean. Just soak with a little liquid soap and clean with soft sponge.Highly recommended if you want to go healthy and not have any hassles of deep frying!Totally value for money!,This is a pretty good air fryer, does the job well.,This inalsa Airfryer is very trustworthy and very easy to use ,does the job and has a very reasonable rate.does perfect Airfryer job 👍,Inalsa air fryer 4 L is a very good quality product. It came in good packing. We are using it for four days. We fried, fryums, fish etc. It is good to springle some oil on fish. We cooked porotta also. All came out good. The digital board works well. We can add more temp or time. Finishing good. Hot air do not come out in excess. I recommend it for a family of 5 members.,I purchased this product from Amazon and got my delivery on time. I also got a call from Inalsa customer care on date of delivery to book the product demo. The demo technician also arrived on time as per slot allotted and explained about the product very professionally. I liked the product and customer care. Go for this product!,The first look of the product is really impressive. It works good too. I am happy with the purchase.,Cheap and best Good design, less noisy and good air through,Good one..

I got the order within 2 days,The product is so good for use.,One of the best. Extremely needful product,Expensive Usefull for hostal,Borosil Omni kettle is of good quality and serves the purpose. Highly recommended for every household.,Pros:--Cord Length is good.--Cross compatibility with Prestige Kettle Bottoms is nice.(Initially didn\\'t fit but started fitting over time as we sometimes use to put it on the Prestige Bottom out of ignorance.)--VolumeCons:--Initially the water after heating use to have a smell.--Some discoloration on the base of Kettle(dark lining)Disclaimer: I have used two kettles from Prestige which were also good enough but both of them burned out, one of them within a year and has been sent for warranty claim. So I suppose it is in nature of Kettles to stop working after sufficient usage. Going to try KENT(transparent one) next time. (Shi khel chal rha hai Kettles ke saath, kya karen zarurat padti hi hai ghar pe),V good product,Overall a good product except the inside edges at the opening of the kettle is very sharp.... When you are cleaning it we have to be careful else it will cause a cut on the fingers,It\\'s not working after 6 months. Money waste,Liked the kettle very much.Got the kettle today, and its working fine.I liked the cord length, its approximately 1.2meters long.The temperature knob works smooth, i haven\\'t felt big difference in low and high settings thoughThe lid is nice quality too, and made of glass.Coming to the base, it\\'s good quality too.Instructions manual says this kettle can b used for making maggie, for boiling eggs, for brewing tea.And it says \"DON\\'T USE THE KETTLE TO BOIL MILK\"..... So therr you have it folks, you can use this kettle for milk boiling and milk tea purpose.I found a little dent in the inner side on the base , but its minute only, so no worries, says a little about quality control. But its not a trade of really.And just as any other stainless steel utensils get stains at the bottom on boiling water, this one too.So my opinion, use soft water and avoid hard water.And ohh forgot to mention, there is a thermoplastic egg tray given with and easy carry stick, that you have to assemble.Overall a good buy,Nice product Nice color..,Overall I am satisfied with the product, paint quality and buid quality is good. Only problem that it catches dust very easily so need to clean every week.,Not happy from this product motor of the not good . Within a year fan getting slow. Motor of one our was replaced by within 2 month.another needs repair,Less noise, good. It\\'s look good if they included SS lining for border for brown design,Good product,Noisy fan. And slower speed , more noise.,Remote control spoils the fan operation,Good product Alignment between mug and top springi is not good which resulted water stagnation at top section causing bitter coffee taste,Absolutely amazing….,You can use if you wish to have black coffee or filter coffee. You can’t make coffee using milk.,Initially I got a damaged product and amazon replaced it in a day. This is what I needed to start the mornings. Excellent product.,Good appliance,Decent product for home,Best product for brew coffee lover,Good thing is easy to use, coffee is nice, bad thing is the hot plate doesn\\'t cut off automatically so have to switch off manually and can\\'t put back on to reheat as it will start making coffee. These are the biggest one their models use and you\\'re supposed to trim them as required. Minor hassle as otherwise they perform as intended,Value for money. Suites my bullet model .,Best Bag available for The old style Eureka Forbes vacuum cleaner.,I think my package was old and all the bags look little yellowish otherwise it\\'s fine.,I used only 1 till now.And worked as it has to.,Genuine Eureka Forbes bags works nicely on my age old euroclean xl.,good,Got what I needed So I got it today , I have been using one for years n it stopped working so I thought I’ll buy this for now. Normally I just put water n oil n walla it works but in this one u have a 2wicks given to u which u have to leave in water. Then put one back inside the humidifier. Till d wick stays wet it works n then doesn’t so u have to remove the one inside n dip it in water again to work. Now that’s a lot of work for this.,,Closed small bed room its works.,small in size,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT CAUSE I THOUGHT it will help with my allergic problem,The product is smaller than it looked in picture, U have to use it like using yr mobile while charging..THE POWER switch stopped working within 5 days, so I returned d product.if U really want humidifier for medical purpose then go for genuine ( higher price/ Quality) product.,Absolutely useful product, every home must have it. It keeps your home fresh with it\\'s nice aroma.,It is a very good product for a nice smell in your room,Good, Its a very nice heater but if u want to warm up ur room this is not something u should buy , this heater is just for warm atmosphere around or near  you . Overall its nice.,Good product,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,The build is lightweight but the rods are not attached firmly. The top rod came off the hinges and stopped working in less than a month. It did not even fall down and the only movement is from one corner of the room to the other. It\\'s too late to return now so I\\'m using it with just the lower rod but really wasted my money on this.,Good product,I use heaters all the time. I\\'ve used Havells, orpat and usha in the past. But Hilton is by far the best, generates good amount of heat, better than other heaters I\\'ve used. It\\'s also a good looking one. I\\'m definitely going to stick to this from hereon.I\\'m writing this so more people give this a try and this great product gets its due appreciation.,I’m using since 1 week & I must say it’s very good & best in the market,Heating power is very poor Cord is too short,Good quality in this price range,Like the product great quality and easy to use,Ok hai,Good,Light weight working good,Good product value for money,Mind-blowing performance superb worth for money While it makes enough froth under 1.5mins (tested using amul taaza milk warmed at 50-60deg celcius), the battery holder is too narrow for eneloop aa rechargeable batteries. I did not know this, hence one of the batteries got stuck in battery compartment. Ultimately, it had to be pried out by tweezers.Now that I have peeled the outer covers of my eneloops to slightly reduce the diameters, I can insert and remove them. However, I still cannot close the flimsy battery door. I have to hold and press it while operating it. Of course, there is zero problem if you use costly duracells. Still, the battery insertion process is not at all user-friendly, one has to watch youtube videos for that.To reduce spillage, use tall coffee mugs while frothing.,Not as strong and powerful to froth the coffee,Quality is good.,Average product,Very easy to use , house coffee looks like restaurant coffee, too much frothy n worth it .,This is the first time I\\'m writing review about any product....this is the best frother at affordable cost!,Works well and the product is good for this price, looks delicate and not sure of sturdiness though. Will updare for durability.,Works good . Coffee making is faster. Stop working after few days,Ok,It doesn\\'t fit easily. Little water pressure the filter falls off. Fitting is draw back for the product. Water purification method implied is good. Installation must be made easy.,Having hair problem due to water so bought this for my bathroom. Good quality product but After using it for couple of days filtered water pressure has reduced.,Pros:-Easy to install (pipe comes with 3 different dimensions)Cons:- Hoped it to purify the tap water (as mentioned in their description). Unfortunately doesn\\'t serve the purpose - I measured my usual water with tds ppc meter - the result was 427 (usual for Bangalore). After I installed this filter - it showed the result of 424. Disappointing. You need it less than 100 to be sure to drink it.,Easy to install & Value for money,I used it for a school project and it worked super well!,Old product received. Inside seems as rusted Really Easy to carry and to make waffle in it at a reasonable price,The product is really good...small in size and very easy to use..easy to clean,Very easy to use waffle maker i have small kitchen so this one was best for me its ready to use within 4 min and waffles takes 7to 10 min to bake properly crisp. The batter should be in right proportions and temperature to have a perfect waffles .Now my kids enjoy waffle in his tiffin box too. Nonstick coating , light indicator,  350watts  h,heat resistant this all are best features  of this mini waffle maker,Must buy it. Best product. It makes waffle so tasty. My son like it very much. It makes waffle in a very less time. Also we can make many other things on it like cookies, Biscuits, Sweets and many more,My kids are very happy.... Thankyou Amazon,got this waffle making machine its is very to easy to make an waffle at your homequlity is quite good as well,,Mini  waffle maker very useful awsome produt.... Been using this from almost a year now.I’m home baker and whipping creams and making dough has been easier than ever. Value for money and Philips is a brand you can blindly trust on. The blades are easy detachable and easy to clean. If you’rea home baker who just started off. Please go ahead and buy this without giving a second thought,Very  useful product. Easy to use. I like it😍,Easy to use,Hassle free product, no issues after using it for about 5 months,Easy to use n clean i am satisfied,It is may be 250watt but works like 400watt... Really great product in a affordable price.,Look fir cake making,Awesome products Nice product,,The overall quality of product Is good.but please mention that we have to use electric cell and how much to use,The product is nice in its working. The only issue is handling product. There is no On/Off button to start or stop the blender. I need to keep pressing a button to start and release a button to stop it.Also, it is battery-operated, no charging cable connection is available.But overall it is working fine for me in this amount.,Just 30 Seconds and frothy coffee ready.Very powerful.. .. easy to operate as well...the main body of the frother could be made of a better material,Nice product,Product is ok. Does a decent job of frothing. However, the built quality appears to be flimsy. Plastic is quite cheap and delicate. Have to see how long it lasts.Also the seller promises cashback for giving 5 star reviews so all the reviews may not be genuine..,I like it because it is easy toh use and dislike because it doesn\\'t come with batteries Very good product,Bad Bad product. Please don\\'t buy.,My Requirements fulfilled & Very Nice Products,,hot air flow range not so much,,Good quality,It\\'s doing the great job. Overall I liked the productBut disappointed with this broken item,It is useful only small cuts like kids clothes,,Today I get the product. In the accessory box the pin and saftypins are in that condition.,It\\'s not good for beginners.It\\'s not that simple to stich.. Sometimes the machine will stuck in the middle of stitching....,Sewing machine is really good . Easy to use and good for beginners.,Overall good item for this price. Light weight and suitable for alteration work..., ,Cost effective. This is good for heating your personal self and you will need to sit next to it. Over 1-2 hours, it will heat up a big room. The auto switch-off does work. Very light. I would have loved if the cord has a bit longer.,Its light weight and convenient to use but the jali gets heated... Need to work on it to make it remains cool like Havells.,Fine!!,Be ready for increased Rs. 500+ electricity bill Monthly in Winter during this device use,A bit costly otherwise better than the competition,Useful for very small room only and consumes lot of energy. Doest blow heat too far. Very less heat,Doesent heat room properly. It is not able to hear my small sized room . I think you should go for rod heating heater ,It\\'s nt wrkng evn aftr 4 hours of charging,The motor,  blade are poor,Doesn\\'t perform. The machine gets jammed every time.,Poor quality...never buy such product ...,Pls not sell this time Cord is small and sound while heating,Well built and the buttons have a smooth positive feel to the action.  The kettle heats efficiently and does exactly what it was designed to do, and does it very well.  Well worth the extra cost.  Highly recommend.,Excellent 👍,This is better than expected !!easy to use ,really fast nd above all its safe ....the length of the cord is okay (if you have dedicated spot the vessel) or else a half foot more will be better and comfortable.I can recommend this to all,Wire length is very small,Product quality is excellent. Using the same model for the past 4 yrs without any issues. We use it for boiling water. We boil the water for drinking and for making tea. We use the kettle atleast 5 or 6 times a day an twice in a day we boil water with its full capacity. So we boil water 1 or 2 cups to full capacity everyday.Recently, the lid got detached, so purchased a new one with the same capacity and model. To my surprise, the kettle comes with bigger plug for which we don\\'t have suitable socket. Hence returned the product and received refund promptly.There is no mention of the plug size in the product description. I give 5 star to the product and wish to buy again, only if it is provided with 5/6A plug. Hope Philips takes note of this!Advice: Please use it only for boiling water and there will be no trouble, works for years! The kettle opening is not so wide compared to some other makes, but that will not be an issue if it used only for boiling water as intended.,,Chord length is less. Product is worth. For the product like room heater package should be enough so that it does not get damage ...... and they have not used proper amazon packaging....price is quite high according to size and capacity of the product....After using 3-4 days I have found some defects and some scratch marks....attached in the pics,The heater is very compact, light weight and effective. It looks so cute in a room and doesn’t disturb your aesthetics at all. Loved it. Ordered another one for my grandmother.,Product is useful,Good Product,I have purchased 2 of them & recommend to my friends who have bought it. But now I\\'m looking for the same which is not available here.,Control knobs should have marked scales on the body. Otherwise performance of the heater is good without noise. Value for money and sufficient for 110 sqft room.,i received the faulty product.,Very good room heater,main features of the heater is it\\'s fan.hot Air circulation in average size room is very good. Does not work as advertised at all. The pieces came out all nice and clean ... No hair stuck to them. All positive ratings are obviously bought. I received product without spanner,Excellent product,It\\'s little spongy compared to my last purchased brand which was hard and not so spongy as this one.,Very good and easy to install,Comes in separate sealed packets & a spanner for easy installation.fitting was perfect.. really nice product,seem to be ok product.,The candels are okay not quite good. For this thickness we need to change for every 2 months or sometimes even every one month,Price should be more little bit less ok,got everything as mentioned but the measuring cup was broken didn\\'t expect this from amazon and as well as prestige. except this everything was good,I had a bad experience buying this Prestige 1L rice cooker. The screw on the bottom was not placed properly. There was a gap between the bottom plate and the top portion. I regret buying this.  they already had delivered the replacement but it came worst than the other one so I returned the product.,Like it for less power consumption & quick preparations.,The product is ok but it is small more small than i expected. It\\'s perfect for 1 or2 people. Even my water bottle is taller.,The product is used for cooking in hostel. Only use sponges to clean the utensil that comes with the cooker. Don\\'t modify it.Use of excess water spoils the work. You can saute. Vegetables for two minutes also. Ideal for students living in hostel.,i\\'m using from two months. it is nice and no worries about product quality and strongly recommended for to cook for two or three persons,Very Good product plastic but cool body ,u have to find sturdy surface to put it vertically , on plastic stool it vibrate in vertical position ,u need bigger plug point for it ,very fast and effective heating ,it through cold air too ,price is bit high but it\\'s bajaj so good.very good buy.,Using after only 2 months, the front part of this bajaj rx10, room heater melt starting.,Useful in winter, box gets heated which may cause damage but so far so good.,The body flaps look very delicate and did not align well when received. I had to fix them,This Heater is good for a room with 10X10 ft dimension. The best part is 2 years warranty from Bajaj. Personally recommend you to purchase this product to stay stress free.,RECEIVED DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FROM AMAZON SELLER M/S ROYAL ELECTRONICS INDIA.I AM SURPRISED ,HOW AMAZON IS ALLOWING THIS TYPE OF SELLERS ON THEIR PLATFORM.,Nice product,Nice product I have installed this in my kitchen working fine is just fan speed is very slow could have been faster but not it is slow thats the reason this exhaust smoke very slow but it does exhaust.,Good quality,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/61izko3RxDL._SY88.jpg,speed could have been little bit more,,Beat performance this product.,Connecting wire is too short,Super It does it job perfectly..only issue is temp control is not perfect . U need to keep checking the browness of sandwich untill it gets upto ur choise,Product is good, but the control knob is to be be modified cause after the cooking process completes the control knob should be return back to initial starting place. If not that process timer should be given basically. So think well what happens whether didn\\'t had atleast one option.Not a indicator option.,It is a nice product, easy to use. The grilling function is also wonderful. But the exterior metallic finish picks up finger marks and other spots which tend to become permanent. Cleaning them is almost impossible.,Very good product,This is a pretty powerful sandwich maker, for home use. The product looks good, has a sturdy build, and heats up quick. The sandwiches are made pretty quickly, without burning.,बोरोसिल ब्रांड का यह \"सेंडविच मेकर\" देखने में तो अच्छा लगता है मगर इसकी बिल्ड क्वालिटी अच्छी नहीं है।  यह लगभग Rs 3000 के आसपास आता है।  इस प्रकार की बिल्ड क्वालिटी ₹2000 के करीब मिल जाती है तो कोई क्यों ₹1000 अधिक भुगतान करें।  पहले मैंने इसे review देखने के बाद ऑर्डर किया था लेकिन जब घर पर डिलीवरी होने के पश्चात  unboxing करके देखा तो इसकी बिल्ड क्वालिटी कुछ खास नहीं लगी इसलिए अपने पैसे बचाने के लिए मैंने इसे वापस भेज दिया। मैंने इसकी पैकेजिंग, मैनुअल और सैंडविच मेकर की फोटोग्राफ आप सभी से शेयर की है।  आप स्वयं देख के अनुमान लगा सकते हैं।,Recommend work as expected,Its easy tp use'"
